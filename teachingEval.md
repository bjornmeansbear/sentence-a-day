# Teaching Self Evaluation

## Teaching

How honest should a self evaluation be?

I'm having a really hard time teaching this term. My thinking re: my own abilities and expertise has shifted (evolved? grown? become less naive?).

Teaching is hard. Maybe the hardest thing. How does one get better at it? practicing is hard, I have a much more limited window to practice -- I can't just make students stay longer for me to redo something or try it a different way when we run out of time. I can't pull an allnighter and still get the "teaching" done on time like I can with my won work

What is the point of institutions like ours anywaY? where does the learning actually happen? how to make my classrooms more about learning through doing? how to get students off their computers! how to get them into the world? how to integrate theory and pragmatic practice better? how to get more clients/sponsored projects into the classroom (without bringing too much external structure or pre-definition?)? 

what good teaching work did my classes produce?

update my CV!

update my teaching philosophy!

## Practice

I have been having a hard time figuring out how to maintain my clients...

Dividing one's time in so many ways is stressful and somewhat unfulfilling.

I've been dedicating more and more of my personal practice not to traditional client work but towards research and development of more sustainable (and socially just) design paradigms. This means that my own work (in terms of producing traditioanl graphic design) is suffering -- mainly as it becomes more and more apparent that the normal way graphic designing is practiced is out of harmony with my ideals. The few remaining clients I have aren't bad -- but they aren't really my "ideal" clients either. So I'm figuring out how to extricate myself from them while doing more to figure out what the actual ideal projects or clients might be; and how might I pursue that???

I presented some of my teaching and personal work at a conference last summer -- the AIGA Design Educators Community MAKE conference at the Heron school of art (???)... 

Working on this idea: a climate designer -- basically a designer who is trying to turn their design skills on various climate change "solving" directions. My particular interest is in better signals -- how can visual design do a better job of conveying the coming crisis in a way that actually helps peope do something: showing successes; showing how many "sustainable" practices yield a better life (not a life of acrifice)

I'm also working on materials for dissemenation (setup on a free/libre/open source/public domain model meant for universal sharing (and related to my other vein of working/thinking)) to help any designer, student, and/or educator "sustainabilitize" their work (studio practice; classroom, whatever). 

## Service

In the execution of department and school duties ...

I attend all full faculty meetings; our regularly scheduled faculty assemblies; my committee meetings; and as many department meetings/functions as is possible.

The past two years I have been on the Fulbright Committee and the Sustainability committee. While last year I was technically only assigned to the fulbright committee I still put energy into the sustainaiblity ocmmittee as I felt it was an imperative part of my duties as facutlty to try and make our institution work for the greater good of us all...

for the department I have helped update student learning outcomes for the courses I teach. I've also participated in working on new ideas for our department program learning outcomes.

Since I typically teach many of the seniors, I find myself writing many reccomendations each summer and fall for jobs and graduate school applications. I also offer a lot of advice to students (in my classes, but from the department generally) about doing freelance graphics projects; finding work; figuring out what studios are good fits for an individual student's desires and portfolio; helping craft portfolios and resumes...

I've been trying to be in touch with more faculty across campus to find potential places for collaboration -- either department collaborations or class collaborations... (is that service??? what even consittutes service???)

I've been particularly involved with a new major proposal this fall

I run the sustainability concentration while hugh is on sabbatical 

I typically teach an overload class each fall to help our department -- we frequently have 6-10 december graduates, as one who helps run the regular commencement project studio for seniors in the spring term (Advanced deisgn 2) I've helped our department the last several falls in running the fall version as well... 

What else???

From my previous contract review; I think I have generally done a better job of fulfilling the request for service to the department and the school as a whole -- sometimes to the detriment of my personal work...
