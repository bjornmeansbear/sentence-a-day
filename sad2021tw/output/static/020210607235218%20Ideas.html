</div><div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h2 class="">Sustainable? FLOSS?</h2><p>How does one move towards a more sustainable graphic design practice?</p><ul><li>Part of my solutions are transitioning clients, materials, etc. towards “better” options;<ul><li>what &quot;better&quot; means is relative of course, but in general lower energy, less materials, safer materials, etc.</li></ul></li><li>my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="GNU%252FLinux.html">GNU/Linux</a> (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="F%252FLOS.html">F/LOS</a> generally) experiments are another;</li><li>Reusing old design ideas another. (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Design-A-Day.html">Design-A-Day</a>s; <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Kit-of-Parts.html">Kit-of-Parts</a>)</li></ul><p>One might ask if spending hundreds of hours trying to relearn a workflow and tooling in GNU/Linux is sustainable (the general open sourcery is SOOOO much work to transition too)? But! I am more than capable of reusing much older computers in this realm, so there is a possibility for not having to get NEW computers anymore?</p><p>The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="GNU.html">GNU</a> ecosystem is fully into reusing old ideas — just reusing ideas period.</p><p>The ecosystem for libre tools is more like a natural ecosystem: evolution; variations due to minor differences of philosophy or habit or desire; a plurality of solutions… If the way our tools are built and evolve is more like natural cycles/processes; does that allow those tools to fit into our lives, society, and culture in more &quot;natural&quot; ways? (natural meaning finding harmony with nature; being more &quot;a part&quot; of nature rather than &quot;apart&quot; from nature).</p><p>Do the ideals of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="F%252FLOSS.html">F/LOSS</a> align with the ideals of sustainability?</p><p>Does &quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="all%2520humans%2520and%2520other%2520life%2520should%2520flourish.html">all humans and other life should flourish</a>&quot; fit into F/LOSS as an ideal?</p><ul><li>go into flourishing?</li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Bruce%2520Mau.html">Bruce Mau</a>'s <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="design%2520for%2520the%2520welfare%2520of%2520all%2520life.html">design for the welfare of all life</a></li><li>get some blurbs from my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Towards%2520Sustainable%2520Aesthetics.html">Towards Sustainable Aesthetics</a> essay?</li></ul><p>Where and how do my interests in Design serving a flourishing/welfare of all life agenda and my interests in F/LOSS  overlap; how are they additive; how do they serve each other. Are they negative or at odds with each other?</p><ul><li>Our current capitalist constructs DO NOT improve the welfare of all life;</li><li>the origins of F/LOSS are anti-capitalist — or at least anti valuing making a buck over the good of your neighbor — so, if you have to use software, F/LOSS is more likely to AID you in helping all life flourish than proprietary/non-free softwares. (Is this provable? or measurable?)</li></ul><h2 class="">Waste = Food</h2><p>Free software can allow for more creative waste to become creative food. And, WASTE = FOOD is a sustainable ideal. So, does that make free software more sustainable?</p><p>Waste = Food; what other ways can I find that this is true for creative kinds of waste? As I mentioned before I think that in some ways F/LOSS improves upon this equation.</p><p>Is this also how vernacular patterns/building come into the picture — are free/libre open models the new vernacular (is that how I make my designing today more like the way say a Cape Cod house comes together?)</p><p>Waste = Food is a great idea to apply to more things than just the natural world. Here's a great prompt: the earth's major nutrients are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, &amp; nitrogen ... what are graphic design's major nutrients? (and! how can they be cycled and recycled into new graphic design indefinitely?)</p><p>Dunne and Raby propose that design should explore activities and outcomes that question and challenge status quo industrial agendas—however! for the most part the designers doing this are still using status quo tools! Sustainability (at least the flourishing variety I am interested in) is NOT the current status quo; so if I am challenging the assumptions of contemporary design and capitalist consumerism, then I need non-capitalist consumerist tools to do that with—enter F/LOSS.</p><p>Sustainable Graphic Design is a mindset, not a checklist of &quot;the right&quot; materials</p><ul><li>If you have the right mindset, but still use the wrong materials, does it matter?</li><li>If one uses better materials, but for the status quo aims, does it matter?</li><li>In what ways can I change how I work and live to yield immediate results?</li></ul><h2 class="">Sustainable graphic design does not exist.</h2><p>Sustainable graphic design does not exist. that might mean &quot;there is no such graphic design that can count as sustainable — its all wasteful garbage that does nothing good&quot; — or — sustainable graphic design doesn't exist meaning that it comes together to serve a communication purpose; deliver a semiotic message; and then redistributes back to whatever energy and matter it was before.</p><p>The point is not that literally you can't make it (though that is sort of what I was thinking at first), but that a graphic designed thing that is sustainable comes together to communicate the message it needs to communicate; and then can dematerialize back to its initial parts once the communicative need is over. How does &quot;signs on a substrate&quot; translate to &quot;pieces coming together for a determinate amount of time and then returning to their constituent pieces&quot;</p><p>Sustainability is about knowing what you want to sustain. Libre tools are about a person's freedom to do what they want. If I don't want to sustain our moderno-techno-capitalism, then I should probably use libre tools while creating alternatives... what do I want to sustain though? It is easy to say what I don't want to sustain; less clear to say what I do want to.</p><p>If sustainable designers don't make design; what do we make? who do I need my next clients to be? If I am all in on the sustaino-libre stuff; what are the kinds of things I must investigate? And, how does being a &quot;graphic designer&quot; play into all this when/if/as my projects become more about software development; more about building bicycles; more about actions or interventions; more about proposals and plans?</p><p>I know I like to say how the sustainabilitist principles project exemplifies &quot;sustainable design does not exist&quot; since the objects came together to be a sculpture for an exhibition and then went back to being the objects afterward — but how does that work for other kinds of projects? can I work with clients and still pitch that kind of solution? (do I have examples????)</p><p>Should sustainable design look intentionally different to tell everyone that its not the same? If the paradigm must shift; then the styles should probably shift as well to be clear that they are in all ways different? By just using different tools and typefaces and image sources do you do this? does it need to be more extreme than that?</p><p>What is perennial graphic design that is restorative to culture — that protects and builds cultural health? (the same way that prairie grasses build and protect the soil health of the plains?)</p><p>What does &quot;graphic designing&quot; do to heal and restore the world? how can making anew unmake all the old?</p><p>What are local and reusable materials for visual design? making my own paper? creating sheets of remade plastic &quot;paper&quot;? digging and making my own clay to make tablets out of? firing pages that way? what do I produce with those things? plates to print from? stamps? seals? do I draw and compose right into clay? what else allows me to put &quot;signs on substrates&quot; in a meaningful way that continues to let me &quot;graphic design&quot; but really does something about material usage; education; communication; etc???</p><p>Am I a sustainable designer? or am I a sustainable person that happens to design — everything I design is thus influenced by my sustainabilitism.</p><p>What is the goal of &quot;designing.&quot; If everything is a design project; is making new forms important; isn't just fixing what needs fixing an example of &quot;good design&quot; — does the solution need to be novel? (If I design and sew a traveling silverware roll using salvaged cloth and found silverware is that any less of a design project than designing a new folding &quot;hobo knife&quot;?) IF the answer is no, it's not different, then wtf, what am I doing, what am I teaching? If the answer is yes, it is different; do I want to be a &quot;designer&quot; then? Why not just a vernacular crafter or builder? Is this counterculture modernism? Whole-earthers did some things like this right? Zomes? Papanek's coffee can radio? A lot of reuse; but with the goal of making things people need in the moment? Still new things; but a repurposed or reconfigured materials based on what is at hand; what is readily available? What is design: making things we want? making things we need? Solving problems? what problems? whose problems? What does it take to let &quot;sustainability&quot; or &quot;restorative design&quot; take a hold in mainstream culture/society? does it need to be more of a religion? more of a political party? Do there need to be more movies or kids shows or whatever that fully embrace doing something about climate change as their theme to affect a change? Regular TV news? obviously the current journalism does little. Why? What else can I speculatively brainstorm? science fiction books are a plenty. Can we make this a WWII like &quot;war effort&quot; to fight the evils of climate change? Reframe everything in the context of us against the greenhouse gasses — C02 increasing is the same as the Nazi's winning Europe? What other ways of framing this are there? I need to try more! That's another potential win for Graphic Design — communicating this in as many ways as is possible.</p><p>How does graphic design take carbon back out of the atmosphere? what can communication design (meaning what can signs on substrates) do to get carbon out of the air and into the ground? to keep carbon bottled up? does making bricks of plastic and then shaving them into paper help? does making my own paper from used clothes and scrap paper help? what else can I do??? just picking Risograph isn't enough. Just buying some renewable offsets isn't enough. How does this bake into designing generally? to design pedagogy? to society at large?</p><p>Stabilizing the climate isn't about reducing emissions, we have to _zero_ our emissions. Instead of just lowering things, we need to stop completely and then actually remove carbon from the atmosphere. Driving an EV doesn't cut it. replacing a car w/ a used bicycle &amp; your lawn with a permaculture garden is a much better start.</p><p>to change a system; intervene in small ways around the edges ... at some point that system will react to those changes and be made to change ??? small is not less important than big in a complex system.</p><p>Designing Tomorrow's World Today: What design does this; what did the messaging around Ozone depletion look like? What about Carson's _Silent Spring_ related anti-chemical rhetoric? what about WWII &quot;we need you&quot; type things? Oh man, that's a great resource — war time propaganda posters. Does that stuff work now? what is cultural convincing design now? what is design that causes people to follow and just do?</p><p>Survival of the most generous interconnected groups.</p><p>life-affirming design thing.</p><p>Every graphic design problem's answer is not a book; or a poster; or an identity... it is not necessarily a visual design problem; superficial 2D surface decoration isn't the answer to every problem — though the thinking of a designer might reveal an interesting solution still... Can it always be framed as signs on substrates (signs on surfaces?) even if not a visual &quot;answer&quot;?</p><p>if sustainability is a cyclical, restorative, resilient, flourishing, non-anthropocentric, maintenance-based, stewardship, co-existing thing...... what? you cannot expect everyone to understand what you mean by sustainability — so do we need other words; or do we just need to say that we mean all those other things when we say sustainability. it is a shorthand sign for all those other words...</p><p>Design is about connections. Design is about bringing people and ideas and problems and solutions together.</p><p>Design only works when it is trying to achieve a success for the planet; for the welfare of all life.</p><p>We do not have unlimited energy. We do not have unlimited resources. How does this change our relationship with designing? With capitalism? with our economic ideals?</p><p>What do I want to sustain? What does the welfare of all life really look like? really entail? How do you actually design for this? What kind of design challenges structural inequalities and balances equity, ecology, and economy? Design that collaborates so as to create lasting, positive change in one's community?</p></div>
