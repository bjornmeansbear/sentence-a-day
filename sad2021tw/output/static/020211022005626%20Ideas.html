Not just talk about them in circles.</li><li>I can find out the info, I know the questions to ask, but how do I show people I do this?

Which lend themselves somehow to something social/eco/sustainable?</li><li>What other new ways of presenting myself are there? Writing about this? Other social posts? Can it all tie back to one single website/place to make it easier to find me regardless of path/search/etc.?</li></ul><p>Look for more connections, where do my different interests and ways of working and aspects of my work connect? (Teaching for example, what do I do in the classroom with students that I can do with clients?)</p><p>The Saboteur.</p><ul><li>pay attention to myself. Every time the saboteur shows up, cause me to overthink or not do something... how to ignore? How to do it anyway?</li><li>What are the clues that I'm self-sabotaging?
