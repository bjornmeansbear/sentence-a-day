The goal: create an object whose form embodied the principles it conveyed.</p><p><em>The Sustainabilitist Principles</em> started out as the books on my desk. Where did "<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Sustainable%2520Design.html">sustainable designing</a>" lay within them… I mapped connections between ideas… wrote down repeating ideas… pondered interconnections over time and space of similar principles… <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="how%2520could%2520I%2520clarify%2520access%2520to%2520these%2520ideas%2520for%2520the%2520next%2520designer.html">how could I clarify access to these ideas for the next designer</a>?</p><p>The final output of this direction brought necessary pieces together in an intentional, ephemeral form for an exhibition.

(because, if we pick the wrong thing, say we want to sustain the status quo, then that is what sustainable graphic design is — hmmm!?).</p><p>Ehrenfeld answers that for us too. He wants to sustain <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="all%2520humans%2520and%2520other%2520life%2520should%2520flourish.html">“that all humans and other life should flourish.”</a></p><p>Designer <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Bruce%2520Mau.html">Bruce Mau</a> had a similar goal for the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Massive%2520Change.html">Massive Change</a> project: “Our project is the welfare of <em>all life</em> as a practical objective.” (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="design%2520for%2520the%2520welfare%2520of%2520all%2520life.html">design for the welfare of all life</a>)</p><p>This is what we'll use as our definition of Sustainable Graphic Design for the remainder of the talk: <strong>Sustainable graphic design is “graphic design in support of all life flourishing,” or, “graphic design for the welfare of all life.”</strong>
</p><h2 class="">Sustainable Graphic Design is Different</h2><p>All life flourishing is not the traditional goal of business, culture, and design. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Sustainable%2520Graphic%2520Design.html">Sustainable Graphic Design</a> defined this way is different than "regular" cultural production.</p><p>Throughout western art and design history new or “different” thinking and tools correlate with new or different aesthetic outcomes.</p><p>Sustainability brings with it all manner of new technologies, new social structures, new tools. Should Sustainable graphic design then carry with it additional new forms and aesthetics?</p><h2 class="">An example: Selecting a font</h2><p>Does a font’s appearance matter as much as the energy and material and social ills it saves? Is selecting a font that uses minimal ink the best way to select a font? Would a font that is condensed, that uses up less space (saving paper over a print run; exposure to chemicals to the printer) be better? Can we combine the these? The thinest, most condensed, lightest ink coverage font is the most sustainable? This can easily be taken absurd lengths.</p><p>This is useful for critiquing design choices; it tackles outcomes from a resource perspective; can show a different "visual languages;" but does it embrace “the welfare of all life?”</p><h2 class="">Sustainable Graphic Design looks Ideological &amp; Critical?</h2><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Anthony%2520Dunne.html">Anthony Dunne</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Fiona%2520Raby.html">Fiona Raby</a> write in their 2001 book <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Design%2520Noir%253A%2520The%2520Secret%2520Life%2520of%2520Objects.html">Design Noir: The Secret Life of Objects</a> that “<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="all%2520design%2520is%2520ideological.html">all design is ideological</a>, the design process is informed by values based on a specific world view.” With “the welfare of all life” as our world view, how does that shift what and how we graphic design?</p><p>Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby are proponents of “<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Critical%2520Design.html">Critical Design</a>,” design that “provides a critique of the prevailing situation through designs that embody alternative social, cultural, technical, or economic values.”</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Sustainable%2520graphic%2520design.html">Sustainable graphic design</a> is not just design that helps people and our planet, but design that is also critical of existing social, cultural, technical, AND economic structures; since many of these things are harming all life, not helping them to flourish.</p><h2 class="">Example: Green Acres</h2><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Green%2520Acres%253A%2520Artists%2520Farming%2520Fields%252C%2520Greenhouses%252C%2520and%2520Abandoned%2520Lots.html">Green Acres: Artists Farming Fields, Greenhouses, and Abandoned Lots</a> was a book I worked on with my friend and curator <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Sue%2520Spaid.html">Sue Spaid</a>, for the Contemporary Art Center in Cincinnati, OH. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Green%2520Acres.html">Green Acres</a> featured artists using farming as their art practice.</p><p>The goal: make the resultant book "sustainable." These were sustainability focused artists, how could I represent their <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="ecological%2520inventiveness.html">ecological inventiveness</a> in a printed book? The things that made the production of this book "sustainable" were that it was <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Print%2520On%2520Demand.html">printed on demand</a>, and used recycled, unbleached paper.</p><p>Visually, the book's design was meant to be _critical_; the juxtaposition of small art farm graphics vs. giant commercial farm references via a constrained square grid and the aerial commercial farmland photography. (» <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Critical%2520Design.html">Critical Design</a>)</p><p>While the book intends to say something different, it conforms to common standards of "good" modernist layout. Other than a minor production method improvement, it's the same … ! Is it <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Sustainable%2520Graphic%2520Design.html">Sustainable Graphic Design</a>?
</p><h2 class="">Good Formalism</h2><p>We judge graphic design using visual criteria for "formal goodness" or "beauty" from the systems we must be critical of.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The principles of "good" modernist design are so embedded in culture that they are the principles of "good" graphic designing.</p><p>— Jerome Harris
</p></blockquote><p>Contemporary formal goodness evolved from late 19th through mid-20th centuries western art traditions. The formal concepts of Modernist Capitalism do not so far seem to lead to all life flourishing (it's usually the opposite!).</p><p>What new criteria for formal goodness or "beauty" are necessary for Sustainable designs!?</p><p>(And, if a modern design is made by modernists, then sustainable design is made by sustainabilitists?)
</p><h2 class="">What is beautiful design anyway?}</h2><p>In <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Architecture%2520of%2520Happiness.html">The Architecture of Happiness</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Alain%2520de%2520Botton.html">Alain de Botton</a> writes: “To call a work of architecture or design beautiful is to recognize it as a rendition of values critical to our flourishing. A transubstantiation of our individual ideals in a material medium.” This would then seem that however our ideals are materialized into graphic design yields “beautiful” graphic design. Botton specifically mentions "values critical to our flourishing." If we merge Botton's idea with our "all life flourishing" focused graphic design then sustainable design IS beautiful design. This doesn't imply a style or aesthetic, but instead a shared set of values. We get other criteria to help judge the goodness of a design, not purely formal, but the content, the context.</p><p>Sustainable designers must see the non-sustainable as the less than beautiful. If your design doesn't account for the welfare of all life, whatever the external aesthetics that wrap it, your design is ugly. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Edwin%2520Datschefksi.html">Edwin Datschefksi</a> calls this “<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="the%2520hidden%2520ugliness%2520of%2520traditional%2520products.html">the hidden ugliness of traditional products</a>.” Basically, the non-sustainable is (&amp; can only be) ugly.</p><p>So: A design is both sustainable AND beautiful when its form declares that humans and all other life should flourish.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder </p><p>— Margaret Wolfe Hungerford, Molly Bawn, 1878
</p></blockquote><p>How can both "Sustainable Design = Beautiful Design" AND "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder" be true?</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>“There are as many styles of beauty as there are visions of happiness” </p><p>— Stendhal
</p></blockquote><p>It's not a new idea that beauty isn't the same for everyone</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>"Beauty in things exists merely in the mind which contemplates them." </p><p>— David Hume, _Essays, Moral and Political_, 1742
</p></blockquote><p>How Does a sustainabilitist account for pluralities as to what constitutes “beautiful?” How do we begin to share "all life flourishing" as an overarching socio-cultural value?</p><p>But! If you design for the welfare of all life, it doesn't matter what the design looks like, the design will be beautiful!?
</p><h2 class="">An Idea: Signs Signaling Sustainability</h2><p>Instead of what does sustainable graphic design look like then, a more important question is what values underpin your sustainable graphic design? Or, what values does your sustainable graphic design signal out to the world?</p><p>How does your design makes tangible, makes understandable, something about sustainability?</p><p>This is doable no matter the project; no matter the prompt. There are myriad aspects of climate change and sustainability one might signal. Each even in their tiniest part we can think of as contributing to "all life flourishing."</p><p>This is another opportunity to find the context for which "beauty" exists in a design without resorting to superficial, external styling. We can focus on values or ethics in the unique contexts of each new project.</p><h3 class="">Amager Bakke Vapor Ring</h3><p>A concept that was never made due to some weird problems; but that sent me down this direction: The Copenhagen waste to energy plant is so clean its exhaust stack puffs only CO2 and water vapor. (Its also a public ski hill and hiking mountain) Upon capturing 1 ton of CO2, exhausts it as a smoke ring. Help you visualize this otherwise intangible aspect of sustainability!? (Bjarke Ingels Group)</p><p>(FACT CHECK NOTES FROM ISABEL!?)</p><p>Images? what else?</p><h3 class="">Reverberation Crosswalks</h3><p>Reverberation Crosswalks are fun, brightly colored crosswalks. Just paint on cement and asphalt they still signal a sustainable vector forward. The neighborhood around this intersection is now more walkable. You can't not notice the crosswalks. They contribute to life flourishing in the city. This concept is cheap; fast; easily replicated; can be customized for region, culture, available materials, etc. (Graham Coreil Allen)
</p><h3 class="">solar.lowtechmagazine.com</h3><p>Low Tech Magazine's solar powered website signals how we might visualize energy usage; how we might enable new systems of powering our tools; questions if we really need constant connection; and how aesthetic choices correlate to physical resources even in the digital sphere. (Kris De Decker &amp; Marie Otsuka)
</p><h3 class="">DC High Water Mark Project</h3><p>The DC water mark project visualizes increased flooding and water level rise. The water level rings articulate "oh shit, this place might be underwater pretty frequently given our current projected future!" By signaling this, perhaps we can act accordingly and redirect our present towards a future where that is no longer true. Without _seeing_ your house or office or favorite park area submerged, even symbolically, you cannot envision an alternative.

Steward</a>)</p><h3 class="">Cradle To Cradle</h3><p>The cradle to cradle books are signs signaling sustainability. C2C is a "technical" nutrient — the entire book is made to be taken back into a production process — the pages are plastic, the ink reclaimable. The Upcycle is instead a biological nutrient, made to decompose and return to the cycles of nature. Paper, ink, binding, is all made to biodegrade… This fully signals the ideology of Cradle to Cradle. (Michael Braungart and William <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="McDonough.html">McDonough</a> (with the design Paul Sahre))
</p><h2 class="">Conclusion</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>“There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be named. It is never twice the same, because it always takes its shape from the particular place in which it occurs.”</p><p>— Christopher Alexander
</p></blockquote><p>The qualities that do promote the welfare of all life are, like the quality without a name Alexander presents, ineffable. And like the quality without a name, the aesthetics that correspond with this — the graphic design visuals that might show the welfare of all life — shift and change with different contexts. A wild garden, a biodegradable book, a thriving farmers market.</p><p>In prepping this lecture I was looking for the thread that connected my works together. That thread I thought was: what does sustainable graphic design look like? Everything I make continues to be an attempt at providing more answers to this.</p><p>But, I used to be hung up on the visual aesthetics. I wanted sustainable things to LOOK DIFFERENT to have their own aesthetic… but what I've learned is that the way sustainable graphic design looks isn't as important as the values underpinning the designs themselves. Anything that helps promote the flourishing of nature’s interconnected systems will look "correct" formally. That doesn’t require a (externally decided) particular style, material, or typeface.
</p><h2 class="">Example: MICA Grad Zine</h2><p>This is an interim piece for the MICA graduate admissions office. Visually the goal was to convey the diversity of graduate programs, as well as some of the current chaos of our present. Different graduate directors were trying to convey the values of their programs, could the visuals contribute to that. AND, there was an ask for the piece to embrace "sustainability."</p><p>So, the design decisions are all spurred by those constraints. Free, open, accessible culture is an important value of mine, and that makes its way into this via the imagery selected and the open source fonts. This also gave me ways to find "art historically" relevant images, and repurpose them to my meaning making.</p><p>The printing solution was designed to minimize printing waste — the front and back of this "poster" are printed all as one plate, so the press sheet goes through the press once, then is flipped over, and goes through the press again, voila. This means front and back of the pages were able to all be printed with one plate per color instead of two or more… All of these "values" intermingled here together, do they add up to a sustainable design? a beautiful design?</p><h2 class="">A Final Example: Ecovention Europe</h2><p>Fast forward from <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Green%2520Acres.html">Green Acres</a>. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Sue%2520Spaid.html">Sue Spaid</a>, now living in Belgium, has a new exhibition: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Ecovention%2520Europe.html">Ecovention Europe</a>, ecologically inventive artists working in Europe, and there is another book.</p><p>In the interim since <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Green%2520Acres.html">Green Acres</a>, I heard designer <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Sara%2520de%2520Bondt.html">Sara de Bondt</a> discuss the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Radical%2520Nature.html">Radical Nature</a> catalog designed for the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Barbican.html">Barbican</a> in London. De Bondt's studio wrote a sustainable printing manifesto as part of the research for the catalog's production.</p><p>De Bondt's "manifesto" reminded me about constraints for framing design decisions: How might I re-examine the design choices of _Green Acres_ through new constraints? Could I improve the sustainability (and the sustainable aesthetics) for _Ecovention Europe_?</p><p>One of the items in De Bondt's printing manifesto is "use less ink." This meant selecting colors more carefully. The palette of _Ecovention Europe_ uses no color that adds up to more that 100% ink coverage. (_Ecovention Europe_ uses CMYK: and color palette swatches start at 100% pure C, M, Y, or K, and then are mixed in equal percentages to keep 100% or less total coverage: 50% + 50%; 33% + 33% + 33%; etc.). This resulted in a color palette that was fairly special for this book. Reducing ink also led to a graphic solution, bitmapped city aerial photos as the decorative section markers. The appearance of a filled area is kept, but less ink is used comparatively.</p><p>Text columns in _Green Acres_ ended at full paragraphs breaks to make editing easier. This gave a formally-nice rhythm to text columns, but it was an inefficient use of space. With _Ecovention Europe_, I reduced this space by running all the text the full column heights. This had the secondary benefit of minimizing superfluous decoration: In _Green Acres_, superficial decorative elements filled those blanks left by text columns ending mid-page.</p><p>I even tried to reduce decision making through reuse. The grid for _Green Acres_ had a lot of conceptual reasoning invested into it, and so I reused the page templates, type choices, grid setup, etc.</p><p>As a conceptual exercise, this was great. But, did it make much of a difference? How could this be done differently and improved upon again next time? Is there an alternative to making this book at all? (Should this exist? I didn’t ask that question before we began!)
