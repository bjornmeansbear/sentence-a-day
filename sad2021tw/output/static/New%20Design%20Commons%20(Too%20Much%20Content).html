But it is important work, and I believe would be a popular topic at this conference.

This presentation feels like a manifesto or call-to-action, and I support it.</p><p>Feedback from Reviewer 03: I would suggest making the point of the paper a little clearer. I am confused if you mean to teach us about those commons we have access to now or talk about the benefits of those tools. It might also be a little of both. Overall, it sounds interesting and definitely of use to the design community with just a bit of clarification.</p><p>TECH SPECS AND PRESENTATION DETAILS</p><p>We are asking ALL presenters to submit their final presentations in PDF form, NO LATER than Monday October 10th.

We take inspiration from the world around us, and build on the work of others, creating something new. In our digital age, this process is ever easier, with an constantly growing pool of available images, fonts, tools, and other resources to recombine.

&gt; a commercial system bent on turning the free range intellectual culture that gave birth to computer science into a rude agglomeration of proprietary gated communities
&gt; — Free as in Freedom (v2.0); preface by sam Williams; pg vii

&gt; The notice was simple, something along the lines of \The printer is jammed, please fix it," and because it went out to the people with the most pressing need to fix the problem, chances were that one of them would fix it forthwith.
&gt; — FAIF, pg3 ¶2 L10

&gt;  A program would develop the way a city develops," says Stallman, recalling the software infrastructure of the AI Lab. \Parts would get replaced and rebuilt. New things would get added on. But you could always look at a certain part and say, <code>Hmm, by the style, I see this part was written back in the early 60s and this part was written in the mid-1970s.'"
&gt; — FAIF, Pg5 ¶3

If something is good enough to solve your problems, is it not good enough to solve someone else's problems too???

&gt; Why not share it out of a simple desire for good karma? This system of cooperation was being undermined by commercial secrecy and greed, leading to peculiar combinations of secrecy and co-operation.

&gt; Stallman later explained, \If he had refused me his cooperation for personal reasons, it would not have raised any larger issue. I might have considered him a jerk, but no more. The fact that his refusal was impersonal, that he had promised in advance to be uncooperative, not just to me but to anyone whatsoever, made this a larger issue."

Things to think about:
A lot of people are interested in the canon of white male dominated design culture, for the sake of the argument they just refer to this as the canon of design culture, but we all know what that has come to mean. Here open source design philosophically has a similar issue with what we may refer to as the capitalistic aesthetic, the term may need work, the concept here is that because sole institutions have deemed what looks good. Mr Keedy talked about how international style was becoming global style and how post authentic sincerity, a web essay I will send you, showed that norm core design has continued that trend, but that’s because things that are deemed Libre culture is not sexy or sleek.

A New Design Commons
The commons is a realm of resources that is open for anyone to use. This includes things like traditional knowledge, folklore, and works that have expired copyrights. A Design Commons is a project that aims to create a shared space for designers to build off each other's work and ideas in a more free, open, accepting environment. 

As educators, our role is the creation, cultivation, dissemination, and — sometimes — the protection of new ideas. Better utilizing free, open licenses and tools allows for a larger space where we can learn from each other and build upon the works of those who have come before us, and our contemporaries.

This approach also increases access to people in need or people in novel contexts that traditional design systems may not be considering. it's about rethinking the entire design process from start to finish. We are freeing ourselves AND our ideas from the shackles of capitalism and opening up other possibilities.

We are in a remix culture. Cultural creation is always a remix; lets embrace this. The beauty of most of the open licenses is that they aren’t about giving up copyright or ownership, they are about linking people together, linking ideas together.

When we design using FLOSPD imagery and tools, we are making a statement that we are no longer willing to be limited by what the commercial software companies tell us is possible. We are saying that we can create our own designs, on our own — or on the planet's — terms.

Sustainable graphic design brings with it lots of new technologies, new social structures, and new tools. The more these ideas, structures, and tools are shareable and remixable, the more that all life will benefit. So what does this all mean for the future of design? I believe that we are on the cusp of a new era of creativity, one in which FLOS tools and works will play a major role. This is the beginning of a new Design Commons, one that is based on collaboration, sharing, and sustainability. This requires we learn more about licensing, new tools and file formats, and adopt new ideas around the ownership of ideas. Academia is good place to incubate and protect this new direction.

We are also contributing to the public domain — making it richer and more diverse for everyone. Another form of regenerative designing.

Designers who understand and embrace Free/Libre Open Source (F/LOS) can create more meaningful work, freed from the shackles of capitalist design. We will explore what F/LOS is and how graphic designers can use it to their advantage. We will also discuss the ideological underpinnings of F/LOS and how they can benefit both the individual designer and society as a whole.

Why image citation is (and isn’t) important to the field of design

Open source has helped out the field of computer science and development for decades. This could also help graphic designers, partially by bringing better access to universities and the underserved and underfunded.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Embracing the malleability of digital type, Open Source fonts allow one to open up, modify and appropriate their forms.

Open Source fonts also enable new methods of open-ended collaboration. Using platforms like GitHub, fonts can now potentially invite contributions from anyone.

Loraine Furter and Eric Schrijver work with MICA Baltimore’s students, remixing and extending Seb Sanfillipo’s Open Source typefaces. Along the way, they invent the protocols: how do we work together?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Who am I?
What do I do?
What do I love about it?
What do I hate about it?

The three pillars?
ME
Sector of Cultural Production I am writing about…
Something Timely/Something Timeless…

The triad of the critic (the author), context (sector of cultural production), subject (who/what s being written about), and object (philosophical lens) are at the heart of convincing criticism &gt; but how to get to fun criticism!!??

Timeless: THE COMMONS

Who is the villain?
[[Adobe]]? [[Capitalism]]? [[The Global Style]]? Lazy teaching?
