Dunne and Raby are proponents of “critical design,” or design that “provides a critique of the prevailing situation through designs that embody alternative social, cultural, technical, or economic values.” Graphic design made for the welfare of all life is different than status quo design. So, sustainable graphic design is not just design that helps people and our planet, but design that is also critical of existing social, cultural, technical, AND economic structures (sort of all the options of the Dunne & Raby list).
