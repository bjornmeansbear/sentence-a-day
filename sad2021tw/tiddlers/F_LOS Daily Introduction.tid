type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This essay takes [[Free/Libre Open Source (F/LOS)|F/LOS]]  as a lens to rethink design practice and pedagogy. The paper provides an overview of [[F/LOS]] concepts, figures, and thinking. The narrative inter-connects these concepts with historical design precedent and outcomes from a new class, “[[Special Topics in Graphic Design: Open Source]].” The essay ends with thoughts for how design practice and pedagogy improve by adopting [[F/LOS]].
