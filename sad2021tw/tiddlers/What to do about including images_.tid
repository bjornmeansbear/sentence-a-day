title: What to do about including images?
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Should images be their own tiddlers that are then transcluded? are images additional fields? Is there a difference between when an image is meta-data versus when the image IS the data?

For instance:

*  [[The Sustainabilitist Principles]] > is the tiddler the explanation and then images of the project are their own separate tiddler(s) transcluded!?
