One of my favorite designers, period.

He made furniture, objects, books, posters, art, and wonderful ideas.

[[Autoprogettazione]] is a wonderful [[DIY]]/[[Design Commons|New design Commons]] project.

Mari is a good example of [[Massimo Vignelli]]'s [[If you can Design one thing, you can design anything]] mentality.
