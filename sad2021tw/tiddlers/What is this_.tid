title: What is this?
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

If you come across this "site"? you might ask, what is this? Well, it is a "[[digital garden]]" to use the popular current term. Its sort of a [[ZettleKasten]]. It is mostly a place where questions are posed, though almost never answered. Use this for prompts of your own; use this as a jumping off place.
