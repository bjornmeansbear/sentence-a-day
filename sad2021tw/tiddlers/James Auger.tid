James Auger was among the first designers to question the role of the designer and the impact of design products (Tooth implant, J.Loizeau and J.Auger). He was then professor at the Royal College of Art in the famous â€‹Interactions Design section alongside [[Fiona Raby and Anthony Dunne]]. Since 2015, James has devoted himself to his research projects at the [[Madeira Institute of Technology]] and writes regularly with Julian Hanna on modern design issues ([[Crap Futures]]).
