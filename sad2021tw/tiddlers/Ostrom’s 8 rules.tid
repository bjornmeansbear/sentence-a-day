# Commons need to have clearly defined boundaries.
# Rules should fit local circumstances.
# Participatory decision-making is vital.
# Commons must be monitored.
# Sanctions for those who abuse the commons should be graduated.
# Conflict resolution should be easily accessible.
# Commons need the right to organise.
# Commons work best when nested within larger networks.
