[[Brian Eno]]:

Genius is individual, Scenius is communal

The "genius" isn't a real thing, its all about the "scene" that person was in, there was collective, communal energy and knowledge and work, that's all attributed to a singular individual, but often that doesn't really, truthfully happen in practice. The individual genius is a myth.
