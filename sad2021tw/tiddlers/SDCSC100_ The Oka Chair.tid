title: SDCSC100: The Oka Chair
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

For the [[Okaterra]] [[Oka Chair]], I need to explore: 

* How did this idea emerge? 
* Why a chair? 
* Why focus on locality? 
* Why these specific materials? 
* Understanding the initial spark and context helps explain their choices and trade-offs. 
* What opportunities or aesthetic options were sacrificed? 
* How can these insights apply to designing posters, houses, or even choosing bike tires?

The Oka chair uses local wood—specifically fallen urban timber that would otherwise go to waste (What company? Talk to them?). 

* While wood is a traditional chair material, is there enough fallen lumber to make this approach widely viable? Does that matter? 
* The chair's unusual size raises questions: Is its shape driven by lumber availability or other design considerations? 
* How do material choices and processes shape design decisions? In circular design, the formal output should reflect material inputs to minimize waste. IS this the case?

Working with fallen lumber presents unique challenges—supply varies naturally. Designing circularly means accepting that a chair might be made from whatever wood is available. Customers might wait weeks or months for specific variations. Is this acceptable? Should we discuss these trade-offs?

The cushions use [[hemp]] and [[wool]]

* why these materials and this particular farm? (which farm?)
* What are the benefits of sourcing wool locally? 
* Does the farm practice regenerative agriculture, like silvopasture, combining sheep farming with carbon sequestration and other agricultural products?

With local workshop production, could making fewer, better-quality chairs everywhere reduce our need for mass-produced furniture? This challenges our traditional metrics of success: constant scaling up, increasing production, and maintaining unlimited availability.

Could locality-based production adopt Toyota's lean manufacturing principles, making items only when needed? The current model of warehouses stocked with multiple copies of every product isn't truly efficient. Toyota builds cars to order, producing parts just in time for assembly (is this still true?). In circular thinking, we're not extracting raw materials but finding existing materials to disassemble and transform.

Are there other interesting examples of chairs here—both historical and contemporary. The Okaterra project needs to be featured, leading into the future cone concept, then circling back to the BIG angle as the conclusion (what? did I mean [[Bjarke Ingels Group]]? like [[Signs Signaling Sustainability]]?).

Perhaps I should emphasize circular economy concepts more. Rather than dwelling on aesthetics and ideologies, I could focus on circularity through various chair designs: the Okaterra chair, Christien's flax chair, and their different material combinations.

The Emeco chair series offers interesting contrasts: the aluminum version—energy-intensive to produce but permanent, lightweight, and recyclable—versus the coke bottle version—heavy and essentially an expensive design solution for waste plastic. Then there's the wood version made with Amish craftspeople, combining iconic design with traditional materials and local production. The Emeco navy chair exemplifies circularity—its aluminum can become new chairs or other aluminum products. The locally-crafted wooden version demonstrates circularity through regional materials and craftspeople. 

Should I explore their technical materials more deeply? Just focus on the biological materials?
