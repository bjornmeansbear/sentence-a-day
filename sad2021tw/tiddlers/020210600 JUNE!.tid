Okay, I am going to do something here again everyday. I am going to find random things in my are.na sustainability and design channels, things that can work like prompts. I'll then write several words on that prompt… not sure if I set a word limit, or a time limit. We'll see how the first couple of days/weeks go. March, April, and May were real rough — hopefully things go better moving forward!
