title: Special Topics in Graphic Design: Open Source
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Special Topics in Graphic Design: Open Source]] ran from January to May of 2018 at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). The course asked students to explore F/LOS software and ideologies in producing graphic design. Other than “earnestly experiment with F/LOS tools,” the main projects were working with the MICA library on an identity and print materials, and collaboratively writing, designing, and printing a book that was exemplary of and about our F/LOS exercises and experiments. Each week we discussed how F/LOS’s ideas and technologies might serve the students’ (and the greater design communities) needs better than mainstream offerings.

Three lectures and workshops at MICA inspired the class’ origins. [[Loraine Furter]] and [[Eric Schrijver]], members of a collective known as “[[Open Source Publishing]],”  ran two workshops: one using public domain resources in one’s design practice, and one customizing open source fonts. [[David Crossland]] of Google Fonts visited MICA and demoed new open source variable typefaces that Google and Type Network ,  collaborated on. Ending his lecture, Crossland explained how he ended up working at Google Fonts in the first place: being a lover and supporter of F/LOS. With Furter and Schrijver’s examples for how design practice might embrace F/LOS, and through casual conversation with Crossland about his libre font and software background, F/LOS ideals and tools felt like good exploratory territory for a graphic design course.
