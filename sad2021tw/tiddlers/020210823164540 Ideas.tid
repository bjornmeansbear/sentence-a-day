For something like [[Learning Design for Sustainability]], [[Scott Boylston]] doesn't actually "know more" than me â€” what's my problem; why can't I figure out how to do something with this knowledge? Classes? books? Projects? what is holding me back, what is keeping me from DOING. Am I afraid that I don't actually know what I am talking about? how does one get over that fear? how do I really learn or prove to myself that I've learned what I need to know then?

This isn't a new problem, this has ALWAYS been my problem!?
