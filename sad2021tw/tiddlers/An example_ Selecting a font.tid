title: An example: Selecting a font
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Does a font’s appearance matter as much as the energy and material and social ills it saves? Is selecting a font that uses minimal ink the best way to select a font? Would a font that is condensed, that uses up less space (saving paper over a print run; exposure to chemicals to the printer) be better? Can we combine the these? The thinest, most condensed, lightest ink coverage font is the most sustainable? This can easily be taken absurd lengths.

This is useful for critiquing design choices; it tackles outcomes from a resource perspective; can show a different "visual languages;" but does it embrace “the welfare of all life?”
