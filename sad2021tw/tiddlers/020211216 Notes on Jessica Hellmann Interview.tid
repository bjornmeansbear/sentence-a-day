[[Jonathan Foley]] talks to [[Jessica Hellmann]]

anticipate how climate change will change in the future.

biodiversity loss is a big concern globally a third of current biodiversity will be driven to extinction if not more...

for a place like Minnesota, it is at the boundary of several different kinds of ecosystems butting together. when you live on those boundary locations you are going to see WAY MORE change as things shift right in front of you very quickly.... changes are felt very quikcly in these boundary locations... [[Liminal]] ???

drastic changes to hydrolic systems

way more likely to have too much water when you don't want it and too little when you do need it

restore a lot of the wetlands across the midwest

"we drained those wetlands for agriculture, what if we put them back for agriculture AND for climate change"

wetlands capture water when there is a lot, filter and clean it, and because they then hold onto water they can help put water back into the underground aquifers
