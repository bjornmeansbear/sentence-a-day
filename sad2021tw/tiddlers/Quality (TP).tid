A good teacher (and a good designer) must believe that one thing is better than another. However, a good teacher doesn’t assume that design results in only one sort of “nice” thing. When using design as a critical tool, there must be room for the “ugly” and the “negative” in addition to the “beautiful” and the “uplifting.” Ugly and negative aren’t the same as “bad” and can still be of quality. A good teacher must help each student explore and articulate “goodness” in their own eyes — in the works students make themselves and in work that students admire.
