title: DC High Water Mark Project
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The DC water mark project visualizes increased flooding and water level rise. The water level rings articulate "oh shit, this place might be underwater pretty frequently given our current projected future!" By signaling this, perhaps we can act accordingly and redirect our present towards a future where that is no longer true. Without _seeing_ your house or office or favorite park area submerged, even symbolically, you cannot envision an alternative. ([[Curry J. Hackett]] / [[Wayside Studio]])
