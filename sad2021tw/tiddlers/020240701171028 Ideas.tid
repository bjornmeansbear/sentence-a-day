! [[Signs Signaling on Substrates]]. A Contemporary Definition of Graphic Design.

Here’s a really rough place to start:

!! Abstract…

Graphic design is traditionally defined as the art of visual communication combining images, words, and ideas to convey information. However, this definition fails to capture the evolving scope of design and the rich cultural contexts in which it operates (and WILL operate). I propose a new definition of graphic design: ''signs signaling on substrates''. This definition encompasses the full range of design practices, from traditional print media to emerging digital and multi-sensory experiences. (Well shoot, is it just SIGNS SIGNALING — you're just intentionally trying to control the way signs signal, the messages signs signal? — does it need the "substrate" to be GD over something else?

At the heart of this definition lies the concept of “signs.” Signs are any forms that meaning, from words and images to sounds and textures. They can run the gamut from simple, concrete forms to vague, abstract ones. In graphic design, signs are the building blocks of visual communication, used to create logos, icons, typography, and other design elements. Combinations of signs can become signs themselves. Signs are often modular and multi-layered.

The second key term, “signaling,” refers to the active process of communication—the way signs are combined, arranged, and presented to actively convey a message or idea or concept or meaning, etc. Graphic designers are skilled in the art of signaling, using composition, color, hierarchy, and other design principles (as well as performance, and all kinds of other devices analog, digital, etc.) to create effective and engaging visual communication. Signaling in this definition also includes the MEANING and MESSAGING — what is being conveyed!?

Finally, "substrates" are the physical or digital materials on which signs are presented. From paper to pixels, substrates provide the canvas for graphic design, shaping the possibilities and constraints of visual communication. How is the meaning, the message, being conveyed? on what? to what? what is the delivery mechanism for the sign to signal effectively?

To understand how these elements work together in graphic design, it’s helpful to explore the field of semiotics—the study of signs and symbols. Umberto Eco emphasized the importance of interpretation and context in shaping the meaning of signs. This view aligns well with the evolving nature of graphic design, which requires designers to be attuned to cultural nuances and interpretive possibilities.

As graphic design continues to expand into new media and technologies, this broader definition can help the field move forward, help designers adapt to changing circumstances and keep what’s VALUABLE about graphic design even as our tools for making forms might become more democratized. By recognizing design as a dynamic interplay of signs, signals, and substrates — and designers as the manipulators of all of those — we can better appreciate the potential of designers to shape our present and future cultural landscape(s).

In conclusion, redefining graphic design as "signs signaling on substrates" reflects the evolving nature of the field and provides a more inclusive framework for understanding the full range of design practice(s). By embracing this broader view, designers can create more impactful, culturally attuned work that reflects the richness and complexity of the human experience.

I have a compelling vision for graphic design: By embracing a broader, contextually aware understanding of signs and communication, designers can create works that are more relevant, impactful, and respectful of diverse perspectives. This approach leads to designs that not only communicate effectively but also foster empathy and understanding between people. 

±±±±±±±±±±

So modernism had this kind of formal approach. There's one correct form. Post modernism took a more liberated approach; the form can be interpreted by the reader in whatever way they choose. And then now we're in perhaps a new era where there's more of like a multi layered understanding of signs in general.

Modernism emphasized a singular, correct form; which was supplanted by postmodernism's more interpretive and subjective approach. Now, as we consider our new era, it seems we must move towards an even richer, more nuanced understanding of signs and their meanings—one that appreciates multiple layers of interpretation, context, and sensory input. Treating design with this multi-system approach will lead to a more diverse, inclusive, and perhaps even empathetic form of design…

This is my intellectual intention: we can embrace broader, contextually aware understandings and design specific signs signaling for specific moments and places — when we do this, we communicate better.

!! Signs Signaling on Substrates.

I propose a new definition for graphic design. Signs Signaling on Substrates. This is an abstract and academic definition, but I will try to articulate how this is a more helpful way of viewing “graphic design” in our contemporary contexts and for the future.

As traditional graphic design tasks become increasingly automated, designers should focus on meaning-making and the intentional application of form to convey semiotic messages. Adaptable systems, flexible formal containers, forms that can change as content and context change.

!!! What does it mean?

I’ll explain the definition itself, then go through some existing definitions of graphic design from the field to articulate why this definition is more helpful.

Signs Signaling on Substrates:

* Signs: Elements such as icons, logos, typography, and imagery that conveys information or ideas. A “sign” can also include sounds, smells, gestures, dance moves, tastes, textures, a particular feeling you get … Anything can be a sign, and a graphic designer must be able to utilize any sign.
* Signaling: The act of communicating or conveying a message through cues; you use signs to signal.
* Substrates: The materials or surfaces that signs exist on, such as paper, fabric, screens, physical objects. This can be abstract — sounds on eardrums; vapor trails in the sky; lavender perfume hitting your nose…

This is an expanded definition. If we are thinking about the climate crisis, about participating in more entrenched ways with nature and society, design’s “substrates” and the signs that signal what we’re trying to signal and to whom need to expand as well.

Graphic design must grow to include experiences and interactions — physical and virtual. For diveristy and inclusion and accessbility we must continue to consider that VISUAL communication is limiting.

Designers should focus on crating cultural artifacts that adapt as they fit to new contexts. This may mean that we need NEW signs to convey NEW meanings; or it might mean that we evolve old signs and systems to better change as their contexts continue to shift.

There are many kinds of performance, interaction iwth space, and physical interventions that fit this framing of graphic design.

by signs signaling on substrates, I'm talking about semiotic signs like logos and topography and sounds and how they communicate meaning to audiences.

this is hopefully an insightful way to think about graphic design. 

The study of semiotics can indeed provide a deep understanding of how signs function and communicate meaning, whether visual or auditory. This is at the core of graphic design—using the right signs effectively to convey a message, evoke emotion, or create a certain atmosphere.

the role of the graphic designer to master the use of these signs across various substrates to deliver the desired communication

The ultimate goal of a designer isn't just to be a bookmaker or a logo formulator, but to be a meaning maker. A maker of cultural artifacts that deliver meanings in new ways or completely new meanings that didn't exist before but fit their context or zeitgeist.

The true power of graphic design lies not just in creating aesthetically pleasing visuals, but in crafting meaning and context—in essence, shaping culture. This requires a deep understanding of semiotics, culture, and the social contexts in which the designs will exist. Designers who can master this are not just artists, but cultural innovators.

Designers are often working within existing frameworks, cultural norms, and client expectations, which can limit the scope for radical innovation. And then there's the challenge of ensuring that these new meanings are not just different for the sake of being different, but actually resonate with the audience and enhance communication.

You can't always control the context 

The unpredictability of context is a significant challenge. Designers might create a piece with a certain meaning or emotion in mind, but once it's out in the world, it can be interpreted in ways they didn't anticipate or intend, based on the viewer's background, cultural understanding, or even their mood at the time of viewing. It's a bit like releasing a message in a bottle into the ocean - you can't control where it ends up or how it's received.

We can't control where and how things are read all the time. If we can't control where and how things are read all the time, perhaps the real goal is to create designs that are robust enough to convey their intended meaning across a variety of contexts, and yet flexible enough to allow for personal interpretation and connection…

designing with intentionality—being deliberate about the messages and emotions you want to convey—while also allowing space for individual interpretation. Striking that balance is where the magic of graphic design lies. Where the real “signs signaling on substrates” definition is trying to take me…

Graphic designers have the power to shape how people see and understand the world around them. It’s a huge responsibility, but also a tremendous opportunity.

Design education often focuses on the technical aspects of design, the principles and elements, software skills, and so on. But perhaps there needs to be more emphasis on the conceptual side, the “why” behind design choices, and the implications of those choices in different contexts.

[[Theory]]

[[Critical Thinking]]

Graphic design is [[Typography]], [[Semiotics]], and [[Ethnography]]…

typography and semiotics are key components in creating meaningful design. Typography, in particular, is not just about making text look pretty; it's also about conveying tone, emotion, and hierarchy of information. And semiotics gives designers the tools to understand and manipulate the meanings that different signs and symbols carry. 

What else is necessary for intentional, impactful designs?

!! Existing Definitions of “Graphic Design”

#. "Graphic design is the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content." - The American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA)
# "Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages." - The Society of Graphic Designers of Canada (GDC)
# "Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography, iconography and illustration." - Graphic Design USA

These definitions, though helpful, emphasize graphic design's technical and commercial aspects over deeper conceptual and communicative aspects. They are limited by the status-quo. These definitions provide a solid base but fall short in capturing the true depth and power of graphic design as it could expand in the future in response to changing externalities.

Signs Signaling on Substrates encompasses not just the technical, but also the conceptual, communicative, and cultural dimensions of graphic design.

±±±±±±±±±±

the other thing is that I'm trying to think about the future where we're not just going to be designing signs and logos and books. There's so many more things that we'll do, especially given that tools like Canva and Adobe Express are filling a gap where a lot of graphic design jobs used to lie.

In our rapidly evolving world, the scope of graphic design is expanding far beyond traditional applications. Graphic designers are increasingly being called upon to design user interfaces for digital platforms, create immersive experiences in virtual and augmented reality, design signage and wayfinding systems for complex environments, and more. This breadth of applications suggests that a more encompassing definition of graphic design is indeed needed to fully capture the evolving nature of the field.

and if it's about the communicating aspect too, there's plenty of communicating that happens with sound or with smell or with touch. And we if we're thinking about designing for everybody's senses and designing for like a much bigger picture of the world.

The notion of "multisensory design" is becoming increasingly important as we strive to create more inclusive and immersive experiences. This includes not only visual design but also auditory design (soundscapes, sound effects, etc.), olfactory design (scent marketing, environmental fragrancing), tactile design (haptic feedback, texture in product design), and even gustatory design (flavor experiences). By broadening our definition of graphic design to include all these aspects, we better equip designers to meet the evolving needs of our society and create richer, more engaging experiences.

provide examples of how this new definition can be applied in real-world scenarios to demonstrate its practicality and relevance.

!! [[Semiotics]]:

[[Umberto Eco]] & [[Charles Saunders Peirce]].

* Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols, and how they create meaning.
* Signs can be any form of communication, including words, images, or sounds.
* The meaning of a sign is determined by the sign itself, its context, and the person interpreting it.
* Umberto Eco, an influential semiotician, emphasized the importance of interpretation and context in determining meaning.
* Eco’s ideas align well with graphic design, which is constantly evolving and requires designers to consider how their designs will be interpreted by different audiences.

Meaning being created through the combination of the sign, its context, and the interpreter is indeed a central idea in the work of Umberto Eco, an influential Italian semiotician who was influenced by the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce. This view emphasizes the role of interpretation and context in determining meaning, rather than assuming that meaning is fixed or universal.

Semiotics can be a complex subject — but let’s try to keep things at a fairly high level and focus on the core concepts that are most relevant to my definition of graphic design:

* Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols, and how they create meaning in different contexts.
* Signs can be words, images, sounds, or any other form of communication that conveys meaning.
* The meaning of a sign is not inherent, but is created through a combination of the sign itself, the context in which it’s used, and the person interpreting it.
* In graphic design, understanding semiotics can help designers create more effective and meaningful designs by considering how different signs and symbols will be interpreted by their audience.
