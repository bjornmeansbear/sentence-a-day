Because a student has learned a technical skill does not mean they comprehend the best time, place, or use for said skill. Classrooms are where understanding happens — you can put technical skills to work outside of a simple demonstration or project. Class time should create connections between demonstrated tools, and skills and other larger ideas and concerns (social, cultural, economic, etc.). These connections result in increased comprehension for how one might use design to investigate any presented problem.
