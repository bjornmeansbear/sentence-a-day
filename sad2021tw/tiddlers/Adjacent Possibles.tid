As you make your way through [[The Futures Cone]], some interesting things start to happen. If you start steering for points further and further out from the [[Projected]] or the [[Probable]] as the vector of moves in that new direction, what was once preposterous enters now newly defined possible or even projected "cones" … So, having far out ideas CREATEs new possibles as the futures cone evolves and adapts to where we are "now" …

How else to explain this???
