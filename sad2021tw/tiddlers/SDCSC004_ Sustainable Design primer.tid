type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A [[sustainable|true sustainability]] approach is not just about providing objects for people's physical needs. If sustainability means "[[the welfare of all life]]," then sustainable design objects must enhance human health, benefit society more broadly, and be regenerative and restorative to the environment. Circularity in design helps achieve all these goals. Circularity gives us real constraints and metrics to base sustainable choices on.

[[Charles and Ray Eames|The Eameses]] talked about making "the best things for the most people for the least cost." This philosophy can be seen as having basically into IKEA's approach, which prioritizes reaching many people at the lowest monetary cost—but often ignores social and environmental costs, health impacts, and our planet's wellbeing. Sustainable, or Circular Design asks Instead of filling our homes with disposable items, what alternatives can we explore? How do the objects we fill our lives with benefit us and the planet.

Let's consider a chair in this context. [[IKEA]] is working to reduce emissions, but their business model requires selling and shipping enormous quantities through global supply chains. How might we contrast an IKEA chair with the [[Oka Chair]]? We could examine various sustainable approaches: [[Philippe Starck]]'s [[Broom Chair]], the all-wood chair grown in that English forest plot using traditional joinery ([[Sebastian Cox]]'s [[Products of Silviculture Suent chair]], the [[Emeco]] wooden chairs made with [[Amish craftspeople]], their chair made from compressed Coke bottles ([[Coke Bottle Chair|111 Navy Chair]] or rather the [[111 Navy Chair]], or [[Steelcase]] and [[Knoll]]'s design-for-disassembly furniture. The Oka chair synthesizes several of these approaches. How do we show the pros/cons of each approach in a useful way that passes along circular lessons and results in conceptual content at the end that could be applied to any design project moving forward?

How do we analyze these different solutions? We could start by examining the Oka chair, then weave in discussions of other designs that highlight its key features. They're already analyzing materials—the stool comes with a tag certifying material inputs, outputs, and binding resin percentages. This metric could become increasingly valuable as economies begin pricing carbon and sustainability.

so, oka chair as main storyline. Veer off into short side quests about other chairs or investigations of materials or carbon or design solutions? also compare/contrast modern and postmodern theory to new "circular design" contextual theories?
