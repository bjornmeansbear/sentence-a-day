title: time inconsistency
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Time inconsistency refers to the tendency of the human brain to value immediate rewards more highly than future rewards.

You have two selves: your [[Present Self]] and your [[Future Self]]. 

Setting goals means planning for your Future Self, envisioning your desired future. The Future Self values long-term rewards, but only the Present Self can act. When deciding, you're in the present moment, and your brain favors instant gratification. The Present Self and Future Self are in conflict. This explains why you might feel motivated to change at night but revert to old habits in the morning. Your brain values future benefits (tomorrow) but seeks immediate gratification in the present (today).
