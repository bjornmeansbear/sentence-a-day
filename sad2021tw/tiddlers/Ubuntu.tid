type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

One of the most popular distros of [[GNU/Linux]]

It's a [[Fork]] of [[Debian]] (maybe? -- see [[To Fork or Not To Fork: Lessons From Ubuntu and Debian]])

I've tried it, its one of the easiest to install on any machine. But its slow and heavy and laggy and isn't an improvement over the annoyances I have with Mac and Windows in the first place.
