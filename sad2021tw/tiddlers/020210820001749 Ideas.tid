Seriously.

What am I trying to do?

How might we re-envision communication design as a decentralized, guided process that anyone can be helped to do for themselves and their contexts? how can the world at large be the client? how can "the natural" be part of all communication design outcomes? how does [[the welfare of all life]] factor into every decision?

I don't have answers to these things, or if I do, I don't understand how to do them in my own life, my own practiceâ€¦
