Okay, well, is this working so far? I wrote a few things... but then I've gotten overly concerned with this tiddly wiki stuff. How can I use this platform for WRITING better moving forward? How can I start something, then flesh out the components? Do I try to [[Create An Outline]] as a prompt? Then each day or week try to elaborate on those things; then elaborate on those things; etc? that seems like a good plan. So, then what would be the "outline"? Do some days I just go through the missing tiddlers list and try to fill things out? When do I go back and try to connect more things together? when do I add my own ideas and questions? how do I pull out the questions I keep asking myself!!!!!!!!!!!!
