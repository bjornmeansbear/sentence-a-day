title: Pragmatic Utopian
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Bjarke Ingles]] coined this phrase (i think) in a talk I saw him give — basically the idea is that you dream a utopian dream, but you find ways that you can make it real with what already exists around us. How can we take the materials and systems already available to us, hack and scramble them up, replace others, and make a utopian reality of the future immediately manifest in our present.
