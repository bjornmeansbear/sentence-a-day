* I am combining three important things in this workshop:
** [[Climate Design]]
*** Utilize drawdown? or un goals? for initial content
** [[Meaning Making]]
** [[Free Culture]]
*** utilize flickr commons for images, velvetyne (et al) for type?
*** We will be sharing files with each other?
* This workshop needs a name.

* There is no wrong way to translate your favorite inspiration into a kit or tool. Make wildly poetic leaps or stay near the source. If you create a work that acts as a tried and true homage with clear reference to itâ€™s origin, consider crediting that origin in a notable way. For further thoughts on influence, appropriation, and the like, check out [[The Ecstasy of Influence]], [[Jonathan Lethem]].
