title: It is a pattern and designed to be managed
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When you are on the ground, where you are standing can feel somewhat wild. But if you take a 10000 ft view, it is a pattern, it is designed to be managed... this become apparent. But on the ground for the insects and the birds, it, hopefully feels somewhat like home.
