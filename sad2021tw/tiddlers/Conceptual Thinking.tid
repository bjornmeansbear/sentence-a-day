Different intents require different solutions. Conceptual thinking results in work where ideas based on content and context map to formal conclusions (the correct contentual «» contextual «» formal relationships are found). Being able to adeptly use and describe connections between form, content, and context is key — ideas are only useful if they result in the lucid arguments (meaning it is the correct concept and the correct form for the audience). Design solutions lacking integrity between content and context and form, or work propped up solely by baroque explanation or otherwise tenuous themes, has not been properly thought out.
