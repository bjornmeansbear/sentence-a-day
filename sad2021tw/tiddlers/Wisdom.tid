```
I do not know 
What wisdom is—
But if I knew,
It might be a blue shadow
Where some dumb thing
That never weeps
Creeps away to die.
I do not know
What wisdom is—
But if I knew
It might be a blue shadow.
Wisdom might be trees.
```

How does this connect with [[Wisdom is a very beautiful word]]? or [[Becoming Wise with Krista Tippett]]??
