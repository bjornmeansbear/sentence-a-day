title: People Doing People Things
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

These are people.

And, the things people do.

People go around doing people things. What exactly constitutes a person thing? when, if ever, are people NOT doing people things? Are there good or bad people things? or are people things inert? Can animals do people things? can people do non-people things?
