title: If you can Design one thing, you can design anything
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Famous saying tied back to [[Massimo Vignelli]]

I like this sentiment â€” it takes away the idea that design has to for some reason be adjective or object or area specific. The kinds of skills that let you make a poster will let you make a spoon or house or flag or rug or garden.
