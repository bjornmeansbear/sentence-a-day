LoFi or Lo-Fi or low fidelity.

imperfect. quick. low quality. basically, how do you use less than perfect means of producing the things you wish to produce. This can be useful in a prototyping phase, quickly making things to test before you spend too much time or money on something that might not work. It can also just be a strategy for completing things — sometimes less than perfect is good enough.
