What comes to mind when you read the phrase “sustainable graphic design?” Is there a particular aesthetic? Is there a particular kind of client? Is there a particular visual trope or particular look or feel? How about a particular message? Do you just picture “[[the triple bottom line|The Triple Bottom Line]]?” Is it environmentally friendly? recycled paper? What?
