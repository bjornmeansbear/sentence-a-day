The French writer Stendahl states: “there are as many styles of beauty as there are visions of happiness.” Perhaps sustainable graphic design must take it’s cue from this. Any design that exists which promotes the flourishing of nature’s interconnected systems is sustainable design. That doesn’t require a particular style, material, methodology, or typeface  —  just the right ideals and messages.
