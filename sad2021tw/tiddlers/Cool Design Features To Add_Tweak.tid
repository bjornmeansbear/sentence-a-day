* Better styling overall
** For sure get rid of annoying pink color currently in use ASAP, otherwise the high contrast palette is more or less fine :)
* Templates for different kinds of tiddlers -- like do people and terms and books/sources and writings about ideas all have different things that should be shown?
* show additional info card @ top of tiddler only when there is additional info?
* [[JOM P83 Â¶2 L13]] < - what to do about this kind of meta data from notes I take and include in here???!!??!?
