* Better styling overall
** For sure get rid of annoying pink color currently in use ASAP, otherwise the high contrast palette is more or less fine :)
* Templates for different kinds of tiddlers -- like do people and terms and books/sources and writings about ideas all have different things that should be shown?
* Show in/out links only when there are in/out links
* show additional info card @ top of tiddler only when there is additional info?

!! Done(ish)!?
* [Done] Idea Explorer: Show backlinks AND forward links at the bottom of every tiddler
* [Done] nice way of showing all the useful extra fields on tiddlers in their card?
