title: SDCDC003: Intro wrap up
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The main example we'll explore is the [[Oka Chair]] by design studio [[Common Objects]]. This chair is a fully [[Biological Nutrient]]â€”all materials come from within 100 miles of Baltimore City and are untreated, raw natural ingredients: fallen trees, sheep's wool, and hemp. Since these materials receive minimal treatment, the chair can be disassembled and composted at the end of its life.

Questions to explore: 

* [[Is this chair repairable?]]
* [[What more can we learn about the sheep farm and their sourcing process?]]
* [[What research led them to these choices?]]
* [[What were their inspirations?]]
* [[Wood: should we examine their specific choices and their partnership with Cambium?]]
* [[How to get data on the quantifiable carbon savings?]]
* [[Could these materials have other applications, like paper making?]]
* [[Does that matter for this chapter?]]
* [[Are there others exploring similar approaches elsewhere?]] How are the results different/the same???

I've got the intro sketched out:

* exploring why chairs matter
* what [[circular economy]] means
* and how form versus content versus context plays into sustainable design

We're talking about making things people genuinely need.
