# A Sentence-A-Day (SAD)

_Nano Key Command Notes:_

- line numbers: `shift + alt + 3`
- line wrap: `esc + $`

## What is this?

Writing sentences. Day by Day. Trying to make something. Piece by Piece. It is not actually SAD. Hopefully it will be HAPPY -- or at least HOPEFUL/HELPFUL.

## January

020210101 The year is 2021. The goal: climatizing (sustainabilitizing) all!?
020210102 What new thoughts, what new connections must be made for this to happen?
020210103 How do we act, how do we teach, how do we design, how do we participate in the world when everything is connected?
020210104 When have you thought 10000 years into the future?
020210105 If you can't concentrate, what can you accomplish?
020210106 What is going on with everyone everywhere?
020210107 So far these aren't so much sentences as questions. I only ever have more questions.
020210108 What do I want to sustain? What does the welfare of all life really look like? really entail? How do you actually design for this? What kind of design challenges structural inequalities and balances equity, ecology, and economy? Design that collaborates so as to create lasting, positive change in one's community?
020210109 Open source? Sustainability? how do these fit together? What am I writing about? thinking about? how do I turn something with so many random bits and pieces that don't outwardly appear to obvious connect into a clear and hsort presentation?
020210110 These gestures are undoubtedly utopian? how do I get back to sleeping and working coherently — how do I actually make something utopian? get back to gesturing?
020210111 Where are all the project ideas? where is all the time and energy to make something? Am I stuck perpetually writing and reading emails? Why am I so bad at documenting all that's been accomplished? I digress.
020210112 A long time ago in a forest not very far away. How to write meaningful eco-narratives?
020210113 What could help to make you feel safer right now? How can we help create that safety together?
020210114 Everything is Connected. I say this all the time. What does it mean? how does it have any impact on my work? on my life? on my home? on my practice? on my teaching? on my interacting with other people? Martin Luther King talks about the interconnectedness of all people and things in his final Christmas Sermon... That will be a useful quote at some point in some Everything is connected lecture or workshop.
020210115 Time. Time is on my side. No it isn't. Time is against us right now. We as a culture have wasted our time the last several decades. We as designers have helped use up precious time on the wrong outputs. What can I do right now to right this? How can this last year not have disappeared in vain? What time can I take advantage of -- the present! the now! the future of tomorrow... stop putting things off. do them now. Time keeps slipping into the future. and yet. its always now now. Do something. Design something. Better yet, don't deisgn something, design a way to get rid of multiple old somethings for each new something that is needed.
020210116 Carbon Dioxide. What does it look like? is drawing the element itself useful in any aesthetic way? Does it lend itself to any other kind of sign or symbol? What other meanings or metaphors does "Carbon Dioxide" or "CO2" convey, bring with it? Is there something useful in considering how elements bond? if they can come together and break apart over and over again, what else can we start doing in a cyclical fashion that benefits both sides of the process?
020210117 350 PPM. Why is this the optimal parts per million? how do we get back to it? is there even a lower, better value for the PPM of CO2 to be? Is this important to convey to the average person? does it matter? what else doesn't matter that we can abandon and stop wasting energy on. Is 350 useful in any aesthetic or conceptual way? Can we compare it to a resting heartbeat? some value of useful nutrient in the human body or in a farm ecosystem? How do we start giving these values useful visual meaning from the perspective of a designer?
020210118 415 ppm. we are past 400ppm we have been for over a year. what does that mean? how to we go back to 350 or less? does anyone need to know anything about this, or is this like defcon level, it doesn't really matter to a person to know about it as its sort of unimportant except for when you're literally about to die.
020210119 What does a designer need to learn about the climate? about materials? about the composition of our atmosphere? about the carbon cycle? about the ecologies of our systems? social issues? ecological ones? raw weather and climate science? What!? What is important!?
020210120 Hypocrisy. How have I changed my own practice and life to fit a more regenerative, restorative way of being? 
020210121 Precious Plastics. How do we defeat the idea of plastics as disposable; how do we make them the magic materials of the post-war!? Hm... that probably isn't the right thing... How do we defeat the idea of plastics being worthless? how might we make them precious again? why do we see any material as disposable? why don't we value every element, item, object, resource? There is only this Earth, and so we have no resupply mission; we have to treat travelling on spaceship earth like the astronauts treat being on the ISS!. Okay, so how can designers learn more about this!?
020210122 What messages should we be promoting? Who should I be talking to in Baltimore? What projects should be being worked on? where should energies go other than the foolish things I'm doing now!?
020210123 Poster. Why do we still design posters? What even is a poster? what ever happened to the poster? Is it a lost tool? 
020210124 Who Does This Design Exclude? How do I make this a more informed part of my work and teaching? Particularly my work!? and not just "whom" but also what -- are there ways I am exlcuding nature? excluding the climate? exlcuding nematodes? excluding glaciers? excluding granite formations? And when you ask this question, how does the answer give you real, concrete, objective criteria to bring back to the process? how does one even address some of the potential answers to this question -- who else do I need to work with? to consult?
020210125 Uniform. 1. How should I dress to make it clear that my ideas, actions, designs, etc. all fit together correctly? Is the workers coveralls the right look? Does having a "costume" and a "character" to perform make anything meaningfully better? 2. should things be uniform in their finish? is it worth attempting this as a goal?
020210126 Manifesto. What do I want to be known for design wise? professor wise? What is my actual process or ideology? I say it is "sustainability" -- but what am I really sustaining? Ive done a couple things, but I end up sitting in my house pondering things and thinking up projects I'll probably never get to -- what could I be doing instead?
020210127 I have done so little of consequence. I want to be doing things, but what have I actually done!? Who have I helped? myself? anyone else? Who are my clients? why are they my clients? who else could I be doing work for? who else could I help? what else could I be doing at all? what has been the point of all this thinking and playing around if I can't actually show anything for any of it and I don't actually make any real progress?
020210128 Design cannot only be about itself, it must solve tangible problems. < this is a quote!? where did I find it? who said it? I just have it written on a random sheet of paper, and I didn't come up with it... anyone know the source!!??
