# A Sentence-A-Day (SAD)

_Nano Key Command Notes:_

- line numbers: `shift + alt + 3`
- line wrap: `esc + $`

## What is this?

Writing sentences. Day by Day. Trying to make something. Piece by Piece. It is not actually SAD. Hopefully it will be HAPPY -- or at least HOPEFUL/HELPFUL.

## January

020210101 The year is 2021. The goal: climatizing (sustainabilitizing) all!?
020210102 What new thoughts, what new connections must be made for this to happen?
020210103 How do we act, how do we teach, how do we design, how do we participate in the world when everything is connected? Everything is connected. How do we even understand that -- how do you see and visualize all these interconnections. I mean, human cultures have gotten this in the past, different socieities continue to get this in the present... how do we build it into all of our structures, cultural outputs, etc.? What does music sound like that embraces connection? what does design look like that embraces interconnectedness? what does a political party look like that knows its beaurocracy is connected to all other things? Does "spaceship earth" embody this?
020210104 When have you thought 10000 years into the future? How does the long now foundation help anyone in the present?
020210105 If you can't concentrate, what can you accomplish?
020210106 What is going on with everyone everywhere?
020210107 So far these aren't so much sentences as questions. I only ever have more questions. although, are questions a kind of sentence? all questions are sentences but not all sentences are questions!?
020210108 What do I want to sustain? What does the welfare of all life really look like? really entail? How do you actually design for this? What kind of design challenges structural inequalities and balances equity, ecology, and economy? Design that collaborates so as to create lasting, positive change in one's community?
020210109 Open source? Sustainability? how do these fit together? What am I writing about? thinking about? how do I turn something with so many random bits and pieces that don't outwardly appear to obvious connect into a clear and hsort presentation?
020210110 These gestures are undoubtedly utopian? how do I get back to sleeping and working coherently — how do I actually make something utopian? get back to gesturing?
020210111 Where are all the project ideas? where is all the time and energy to make something? Am I stuck perpetually writing and reading emails? Why am I so bad at documenting all that's been accomplished? I digress.
020210112 A long time ago in a forest not very far away. How to write meaningful eco-narratives?
020210113 What could help to make you feel safer right now? How can we help create that safety together?
020210114 Everything is Connected. I say this all the time. What does it mean? how does it have any impact on my work? on my life? on my home? on my practice? on my teaching? on my interacting with other people? Martin Luther King talks about the interconnectedness of all people and things in his final Christmas Sermon... That will be a useful quote at some point in some Everything is connected lecture or workshop.
020210115 Time. Time is on my side. No it isn't. Time is against us right now. We as a culture have wasted our time the last several decades. We as designers have helped use up precious time on the wrong outputs. What can I do right now to right this? How can this last year not have disappeared in vain? What time can I take advantage of -- the present! the now! the future of tomorrow... stop putting things off. do them now. Time keeps slipping into the future. and yet. its always now now. Do something. Design something. Better yet, don't deisgn something, design a way to get rid of multiple old somethings for each new something that is needed.
020210116 Carbon Dioxide. What does it look like? is drawing the element itself useful in any aesthetic way? Does it lend itself to any other kind of sign or symbol? What other meanings or metaphors does "Carbon Dioxide" or "CO2" convey, bring with it? Is there something useful in considering how elements bond? if they can come together and break apart over and over again, what else can we start doing in a cyclical fashion that benefits both sides of the process?
020210117 350 PPM. Why is this the optimal parts per million? how do we get back to it? is there even a lower, better value for the PPM of CO2 to be? Is this important to convey to the average person? does it matter? what else doesn't matter that we can abandon and stop wasting energy on. Is 350 useful in any aesthetic or conceptual way? Can we compare it to a resting heartbeat? some value of useful nutrient in the human body or in a farm ecosystem? How do we start giving these values useful visual meaning from the perspective of a designer?
020210118 415 ppm. we are past 400ppm we have been for over a year. what does that mean? how to we go back to 350 or less? does anyone need to know anything about this, or is this like defcon level, it doesn't really matter to a person to know about it as its sort of unimportant except for when you're literally about to die.
020210119 What does a designer need to learn about the climate? about materials? about the composition of our atmosphere? about the carbon cycle? about the ecologies of our systems? social issues? ecological ones? raw weather and climate science? What!? What is important!?
020210120 Hypocrisy. How have I changed my own practice and life to fit a more regenerative, restorative way of being?
020210121 Precious Plastics. How do we defeat the idea of plastics as disposable; how do we make them the magic materials of the post-war!? Hm... that probably isn't the right thing... How do we defeat the idea of plastics being worthless? how might we make them precious again? why do we see any material as disposable? why don't we value every element, item, object, resource? There is only this Earth, and so we have no resupply mission; we have to treat travelling on spaceship earth like the astronauts treat being on the ISS!. Okay, so how can designers learn more about this!?
020210122 What messages should we be promoting? Who should I be talking to in Baltimore? What projects should be being worked on? where should energies go other than the foolish things I'm doing now!?
020210123 Poster. Why do we still design posters? What even is a poster? what ever happened to the poster? Is it a lost tool?
020210124 Who Does This Design Exclude? How do I make this a more informed part of my work and teaching? Particularly my work!? and not just "whom" but also what -- are there ways I am exlcuding nature? excluding the climate? exlcuding nematodes? excluding glaciers? excluding granite formations? And when you ask this question, how does the answer give you real, concrete, objective criteria to bring back to the process? how does one even address some of the potential answers to this question -- who else do I need to work with? to consult?
020210125 Uniform. 1. How should I dress to make it clear that my ideas, actions, designs, etc. all fit together correctly? Is the workers coveralls the right look? Does having a "costume" and a "character" to perform make anything meaningfully better? 2. should things be uniform in their finish? is it worth attempting this as a goal?
020210126 Manifesto. What do I want to be known for design wise? professor wise? What is my actual process or ideology? I say it is "sustainability" -- but what am I really sustaining? Ive done a couple things, but I end up sitting in my house pondering things and thinking up projects I'll probably never get to -- what could I be doing instead?
020210127 I have done so little of consequence. I want to be doing things, but what have I actually done!? Who have I helped? myself? anyone else? Who are my clients? why are they my clients? who else could I be doing work for? who else could I help? what else could I be doing at all? what has been the point of all this thinking and playing around if I can't actually show anything for any of it and I don't actually make any real progress?
020210128 Design cannot only be about itself, it must solve tangible problems. < this is a quote!? where did I find it? who said it? I just have it written on a random sheet of paper, and I didn't come up with it... anyone know the source!!??
020210129 How does being part of a worker union benefit people? Is it part of a sustainability agenda? Is the green new deal about union jobs and workers? Does unionization go in hand with sustainabilitizing?
020210130 A carbon sequestering book. So what does on need to make this work -- 1. paper. Some alternative fiber paper; 50% recycled content; 50% permaculture grown prairiegrass fiber or something? reusing waste and practicing regenerative agriculture. 2. Ink. This is the real special sauce. How can something be printed clear; then the composition of the ink absorbs carbon dioxide out of the air, stores the carbon, and slowly darkens to carbon black over time!?!?!?! Oh, and is this compostable at the end of its life as well? 3. Cover. Again, cover needs to be compostable, recycled + permaculture fibers, and perhaps the type/image on the cover is just blind debossed? 4. Binding. Perfect bind? use some sort of compostable glue? What else would need to be figured out?
020210131 Plastic Bottle. There are so many options for doing something with you bottle. What can I do!? how to I get to a place where I'm actually accomplishing anything I say I want/need to do on the precious plastics front?

## February

020210201 Another month. time keeps slipping away. What has been accomplished towards carbon drawdown goals in the last month? GM says they're going to exclusively EVs in the next 10 years, that's good. What am I doing? How to lead? How to do anything real, aything useufl? how to operate at the local level? how to be helpful? don't worry about notereity or externally recognized success. Just worry about actually doing something that benefits more than yourself......... that's part of sustainability for sure.
020210202 A climate project? what kinds of projects help promote doing something, learning something, solutioning something about our climate crisis? regular design projects that we just tweak the content or something of? regular projects with new constraints? or do we need completely new projects!? is the problem the content and the materials? or is the problem the way design works, the neo-liberal consumer capitalist nonsense? Always new. No maintenance. Objects that are meant for short term individual ownership. Design is complicit in promoting all that, designing for those ideals and sustems -- even designing those ideas and systems in the first place. So, what are climate design projects? how do we get the welfare of all life into every project? how do we get drawing down carbon dioxide into every project? How do we get the donut economy into every single project?
020210203 Why do we design? is it to be a designer -- meaning to have a job? or is it for some more meaningful reason -- you need something; you're helping someone; you're repairing or improving upon a system; why design? is this necessary? who benefits? who suffers? If the only reason you are desiging is that its a job, well, what are oyu designing? does your job have you designing the future's (or this afternoons even) trash? Are you in the waste creation business or the improving things business? when you're improving things, are you factoring in imprvoing the whole earth? or just some market metric? Let's focus on the whole earth above all else.
020210204 The process is part of the final. What does this mean? How does one's process become apparent; how is it the important aspect? does it relate to other kinds of context that affect how one chooses to go about designing in the first place?
020210205 Uncertainty. You have to be okay with Uncertainty. What if we design and build sytems that plan for uncertainty? that take uncertainty into account? is this a way to design better? to build better? to adpat better as we go? We know we won't be able to predict things and that outcomes will surprise us... so why not design this way too??? I can't know everything -- so how do I plan for this? a) we need more people involved in more things... we need to talk to each other more. I need to talk to more people. But how do we understand uncertainty? how to embrace uncertainty?
020210206 I am struggling. Habits form slowly. Some are easy. Some are not. How to get over staying up late and instead go to bed, then maybe wake up a bit earlier? Why is 2200–0200 my ultimate working time?
020210207 Habits to start? earlier to bed. earlier to rise. exercise. live stream working. make more videos that explain my ideas to students and the world at large. How to feel compelled to do these things? can you train yourself to do that? to participate in these things in new, larger ways?
020210208 These Gestures are undoubtedly utopian. What of my projects fit under this umbrella? Where does this start? how far back does it go? how might it be a great organizing principle for my projects? for a lecture? Is my initial Senior project from undergrad too far away to start with? that works -- telling the "I was on an engineering track, then I switched to art..." story? what about working at sundaysenergy? my own grad school experience? how to turn that into a compelling narrative that is also artfully illustrated AND relevant to social/ecological/sustainable things today? the signs signalling sustaainability is also utopian!?
020210209 How do I make all of these questions and ideas and bits and pieces go together in a coherent and useful way that actually generates out content I can quickly do something with? how does this actually help me understand what I'm trying to do? how does it make more meaning? how does it enable me to help real people? how does it get me to do the things I am not good at doing? What does sustainability mean? do I even know? who is harmed by my inaction? who is harmed by my actions? Too far too fast...
020210210 Climate Change. So the climate is changing. What does that mean. Social climates, ecological climates, both. How are climate and weather related? how does graphic design show or make this all more understandable? is focusing on climate change even important? is it too big? too abstract? What's the perspective of Drawdown.org on that idea? What about The Climate Mobilization? How does Climate Designers fit into all of this? What framework or ideology should lead? What about AirMiners? as a community do they have any stronger organizing principle or concepts other than just "get carbon out of the atmosphere and into other sinks?" What is the minimum you need to learn to understand this? to have enough people grok this to actually change some behaviors? to change some social and cultural structures? What does a climate friendly museum look like? what does a climate friendly school look like? what does a climate friendly
020210211 I am lost. Design is not the answer. What I am currently doing is not the answer. Where is the meaningful connection? Where is the organizing on at the grassroots level? who do I need to talk to? How does someone actually make progress on complicated issues? just doing things? what's holding me back?
