# A Sentence-A-Day (SAD)

_Nano Key Command Notes:_

- line numbers: `shift + alt + 3`
- line wrap: `esc + $`

## What is this?

Writing sentences. Day by Day. Trying to make something. Piece by Piece. It is not actually SAD. Hopefully it will be HAPPY -- or at least HOPEFUL/HELPFUL.

## January

020210101 The year is 2021. The goal: climatizing (sustainabilitizing) all!?
020210102 What new thoughts, what new connections must be made for this to happen?
020210103 How do we act, how do we teach, how do we design, how do we participate in the world when everything is connected?
020210104 When have you thought 10000 years into the future?
020210105 If you can't concentrate, what can you accomplish?
020210106 What is going on with everyone everywhere?
020210107 So far these aren't so much sentences as questions. I only ever have more questions.
020210108 What do I want to sustain? What does the welfare of all life really look like? really entail? How do you actually design for this? What kind of design challenges structural inequalities and balances equity, ecology, and economy? Design that collaborates so as to create lasting, positive change in one's community?
020210109 Open source? Sustainability? how do these fit together? What am I writing about? thinking about? how do I turn something with so many random bits and pieces that don't outwardly appear to obvious connect into a clear and hsort presentation?
020210110 These gestures are undoubtedly utopian? how do I get back to sleeping and working coherently — how do I actually make something utopian? get back to gesturing?
020210111 Where are all the project ideas? where is all the time and energy to make something? Am I stuck perpetually writing and reading emails? Why am I so bad at documenting all that's been accomplished? I digress.
020210112 A long time ago in a forest not very far away. How to write meaningful eco-narratives?
020210113 What could help to make you feel safer right now? How can we help create that safety together?

020210123 Poster. Why do we still design posters? What even is a poster? what ever happened to the poster? Is it a lost tool? 
020210124 Who Does This Design Exclude? How do I make this a more informed part of my work and teaching? Particularly my work!? and not just "whom" but also what -- are there ways I am exlcuding nature? excluding the climate? exlcuding nematodes? excluding glaciers? excluding granite formations? And when you ask this question, how does the answer give you real, concrete, objective criteria to bring back to the process? how does one even address some of the potential answers to this question -- who else do I need to work with? to consult?
020210125 Uniform. 1. How should I dress to make it clear that my ideas, actions, designs, etc. all fit together correctly? Is the workers coveralls the right look? Does having a "costume" and a "character" to perform make anything meaningfully better? 2. should things be uniform in their finish? is it worth attempting this as a goal?
020210126 Manifesto. What do I want to be known for design wise? professor wise? What is my actual process or ideology? I say it is "sustainability" -- but what am I really sustaining? Ive done a couple things, but I end up sitting in my house pondering things and thinking up projects I'll probably never get to -- what could I be doing instead?
020210127 I have done so little of consequence. I want to be doing things, but what have I actually done!? Who have I helped? myself? anyone else? Who are my clients? why are they my clients? who else could I be doing work for? who else could I help? what else could I be doing at all? what has been the point of all this thinking and playing around if I can't actually show anything for any of it and I don't actually make any real progress?
020210128 Design cannot only be about itself, it must solve tangible problems. < this is a quote!? where did I find it? who said it? I just have it written on a random sheet of paper, and I didn't come up with it... anyone know the source!!??
