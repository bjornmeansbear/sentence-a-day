Notes:
line numbers: shift + alt + 3
line wrap: esc + $
```

Writing sentences. Day by Day. Trying to make something. Piece by Piece. It is not actually SAD. Hopefully it will be HAPPY -- or at least HOPEFUL/HELPFUL.

020210103 How do we act, how do we teach, how do we design, how do we participate in the world when everything is connected?
020210104 When have you thought 10000 years into the future?
020210105 If you can't concentrate, what can you accomplish?
020210106 What is going on with everyone everywhere?
