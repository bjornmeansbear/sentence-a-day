(how much of the last couple of years to carry over / and should I just automatically not repeat stuff that might have been used in the CCFAAD class in case there are duplicate students!??)

The goal for this is to be the last year of this class. Readings will be partially from the avant garde and coutner culture and radical pedagogy -- the goal: create a frame work for design educating that integrates sustainability as a core principle.

There is only one project: create a set of documents, posters, whatever that we can pass out to our fellow colleagues and professors for better integration of sustainability/fighting climate change into any and all graphic designing.

What are new metrics? How do we take formal lessons and turn them into climate or sustainability lessons? How does design save energy? produce energy? reduce carbon? sequester carbon? recycle or restore materials!?

What are symbolic graphic gestures that make the public aware and act!?
