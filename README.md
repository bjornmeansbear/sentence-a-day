# A Sentence A Day (SAD)
Writing sentences. Day by Day. Trying to make something. Piece by Piece. It is not actually SAD. Hopefully it will be HAPPY -- or at least HOPEFUL/HELPFUL.

20190101 How to move towards a more sustainable graphic design practice?
20190102 My GNU/Linux experiments are one such effort.
20190103 Reusing old design ideas another.
20190104 Now, is spending hundreds of hours trying to learn things about GNU/Linux sustainable though (the general open sourcery as a whole)?
20190105 The GNU ecosystem is fully into reusing old ideas — just reusing ideas period.
20190106 Free software allows for creative waste to become creative food.
20190107 Does that make free software as a whole more sustainable?
20190108 The ecosystem for libre tools is more like a natural ecosystem: you see darwinian style evolution; variations due to minor differences of philosophy or habit or desire.
20190109-1 If the way our tools are built and subsequently evolve is more like nature; more like natural cycles/processes; does that make those tools then fit into our lives, society, culture — whatever — in more “natural” ways? does it allow for more natural ways of using them? (natural meaning finding harmony with nature; being more "a part" of nature rather than "apart" from nature...) [something about Eli Heuer's open source over estimates your skills, so you have to learn and grow and try harder?]
20190109-2 github is my new dropbox. but should I switch to gitlab? that's open... oh, should I run my own gitlab server???
20190110 How about the ideals?
20190111 Do the ideals of F/LOSS align better with the ideals of sustainability?
20190112 Does "all humans and other life should flourish" fit into F/LOSS as an ideal?
20190113 Or rather, does F/LOSS help achieve flourishing more than proprietary software might/will?
20190114 What I am really trying to suss out here is where and how do my interests in Design serving a flourishing/wellfare of all life agenda 
and my interests in F/LOSS design overlap; how are they additive; how do they serve each other.
20190115 The other direction this goes, is why do any of this at all? why design? why compute? why care about liberated tools? why be a designer — why am I not just a farmer or garbage collector or something?
