# A Sentence A Day (SAD)

Writing sentences. Day by Day. Trying to make something. Piece by Piece. It is not actually SAD. Hopefully it will be HAPPY -- or at least HOPEFUL/HELPFUL.

20190101 How to move towards a more sustainable graphic design practice?
20190102 My GNU/Linux experiments are one such effort.
20190103 Reusing old design ideas another.
20190104 Now, is spending hundreds of hours trying to learn things about GNU/Linux sustainable though (the general open sourcery as a whole)?
20190105 The GNU ecosystem is fully into reusing old ideas -- just reusing ideas period.
20190106 Free software allows for creative waste to become creative food.
20190107 Does that make free software as a whole more sustainable?
20190108 The ecosystem for libre tools is more like a natural ecosystem: you see darwinian style evolution; variations due to minor differences of philosophy or habit or desire.
20190109 If the way our tools are built and subsequently evolve is more like nature; more like natural cycles/processes; does that make those tools then fit into our lives, society, culture -- whatever -- in more "natural" ways? does it allow for more natural ways of using them? (natural meaning finding harmony with nature; being more "a part" of nature rather than "apart" from nature... (something about Eli Heuer's open source over estimates your skills, so you have to learn and grow and try harder? -- <https://twitter.com/eliheuer/status/1081627442220068865>))
20190109 Github is my new dropbox. but should I switch to gitlab? that's open... oh, should I run my own gitlab server???
20190110 How about the ideals?
20190111 Do the ideals of F/LOSS align better with the ideals of sustainability?
20190112 Does "all humans and other life should flourish" fit into F/LOSS as an ideal?
20190113 Or rather, does F/LOSS help achieve flourishing more than proprietary software might/will?
20190114 What I am really trying to suss out here is where and how do my interests in Design serving a flourishing/wellfare of all life agenda and my interests in F/LOSS design overlap; how are they additive; how do they serve each other.
20190115 The other direction this goes, is why do any of this at all? why design? why compute? why care about liberated tools? why be a designer -- why am I not just a farmer or garbage collector or something?
20190115 Okay, reasoning: our current capitalist constructs DO NOT improve the wellfare of all life; the origins of F/LOSS are also anti-capitalist -- or at least anti valuing making a buck over being good to your neighbor -- so, if you have to use software, F/LOSS is more likely to AID you in helping all life flourish than proprietary/non-free softwares.
20190116 Is this provable? or measurable?
20190117 Waste = Food; what other ways can I find that this is true for creative kinds of waste? As I mentioned before I think that in some ways F/LOSS improves upon this equation.
20190118 The philosophical issue I run into here is, well, what exactly is my goal as a designer? what do I want to design? is designing solving any of the problems I am pointing out -- did it just create them in the first place?
20190118 The Libre Designer; The Sustainabilitist Designer; Are the tools the connection? are these things the same? It feels like a synergy...
20190119 Is this also how vernacular patterns/building come into the picture -- are free/libre open models the new vernacular (is that how I make my designing today more like the way say a Cape Cod house comes together?)
20190120 It is good to experience other spaces, other realms, where what graphic design is used for is different (and how graphic design looks is understood differently).
20190120 Dunne and Raby propose that design should explore activities and outcomes that question and challenge status quo industrial agendas--however! for the most part the designers doing this are still using status quo tools! Sustainability (at least the flourishing variety I am interested in) is NOT the current status quo; so if I am challenging the assumptions of contemporary design and capitalist consumerism, then I need non-capitalist consumerist tools to do that with--enter F/LOSS.
20190121 F/LOSS seems to be hard for traditional designers to break into though. Why?
20190122 Web focused designers HAVE for the most part embraced the open source ideal -- work is on github, there are at least many designers using things like bootstrap, react, etc. And plenty, though less, committing to projects and making their own new ones (jxnblk & mrmrs are good examples).
20190123 Even more traditionally print designers; or just designers designing for the web even if they aren't capable of building/programming are aware of plenty of open projects and open source fonts (google fonts) -- so what's the hard part to migrate designing tools???
20190124 An issue may just be that while the web is built on open standards, our traditional desktop computers have not. So, while you might be used to thinking in SVG and JS and HTML and CSS and Wordpress and Drupal and React and Node and whatever other F/LOS kinds of things in a web realm; you aren't necessarily thiknking about making those things w/ free/open tools.
20190125 Creating graphics has for the most part been a proprietary environment -- one had to buy fonts, or at least access to the fonts (you had to buy a case of type; you had to buy sheets of letraset; you had to pay a phototypesetter for the type you wanted set and they bought their font photo-negatives from the foundries, etc.), and when the creation of layouts moved to the computer... hmmm, losing my train of thought here.
20190125 Generalization: designers are tool users not tool makers? so we use what we see is available; when we're shown the Adobe stuff and see that mostly the rest of our colleagues are using it; it makes sense to do that -- the file formats don't port, so we have not much choice.
20190129 Why have a process? What is a process? what is process? How do you define process?
20190130 Does "Switch to libre tools" count as a process?
20190131 Do you have to change your computer, your operating system, your software; or are there just free/libre

20190201 Sustainable Graphic Design is a mindset, not necessarily a checklist of "the right" materials -- now, it can't be the wrong materials either, but it's not just the right materials...
20190202 If you have the right mindset, but still use the wrong materials, does it matter?
20190203 If one uses better materials, but for the status quo aims, does it matter?
20190204 In what ways can I change how I work and live to yield immediate results?
20190205 I now have 3 iMacs, 5 Laptops, 3 raspberry Pis, & 5 Monitors of different sizes and ages (one is the sweet 1999 original Apple LCD in translucent turquoise). Is that too many computers?
20190206 Documentation of my libre attempts are a must. I need to find the time to actually get down some of the things I've tried and learned.  
20190207 Is writing or audio/video recording better for that? I'll do it faster as audio recordings; but its more accessible as text right?
20190208 Waste = Food is a great idea to apply to more things than just the natural world. Here's a great prompt: the earth's major nutrients are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, & nitrogen ... what are graphic design's major nutrients? (and! how can they be cycled and recycled into new graphic design indefinitely?????????)
20190208 Oh man, I need to setup a repo of just my fav libre fonts. then I can easily keep all my installs mac, gnu/linux, whatever, in sync.
20190209 As I get into this liberated OS, fonts, tools, etc. I realize that there have been more convenient, more helpful, more useful, whatever systems out there -- and most of us just never knew/didn't realize???
20190210 Some things are easier. Some are harder.
20190211 What the f is up with crappy weather days.
20190212 I have this idea -- sustainable graphic design does not exist. Now, that might mean "there is no such graphic design that can count as sustainable -- its all wasteful garbage that does nothing good" -- or -- and this is the cool part -- sustainable graphic design doesn't exist meaning that it comes together to serve a communication purpose; deliver a semiotic message; and then redistributes back to whatever energy and matter it was before.
20190212 Maybe try to write some more about that in another doc or repo or something? Reference my MFA work; what else can I find that is exemplary of that idea?
20190212 That's more than just reuse for packaging or something; that is about harnessing a more entropic way of being.
20190213 What the hell am I doing.
20190214 What is romantic about sustainability? should we focus on that? are the facts and statistics and whatever else too scary? too boring? too real?
20190215 If there is a crisis, why aren't we hearing about it more? why aren't there more restrictions?
20190216 Sustainability is about knowing what you want to sustain. Libre tools are about a person's freedom to do what they want. If I don't want to sustain our moderno-techno-capitalism, then I should probably use libre tools while creating alternatives... what do I want to sustain though? It is easy to say what I don't want to sustain; less clear to say what I do want to.
20190217 I just spent the evening at an event that showed me why all is F-ed. I feel bad that I was a part of it frankly. So then what am I going to do to do something about that?
20190218 Designer as Activist. Designer as Farmer. Designer as Politician. Designer as general good doer out in the world -- not in the social design-y way, but just as regular person doing things to improve the contexts of their time and space.
20190219 What good do any of my design "tools" do me if just being a general good citizen; a general good human; is what I am after?
20190220 A designer needs to know a lot to really be good these days. I don't mean good as in makes formally pleasing work; I mean good as in really improves things; really exemplifies other ways of thinking and being. So how does one get this way? is this something to be learned? something to be taught? Is pedagogy buildable from these thoughts? If i teach in a graphic design program still rooted mainly in typography and static, flat, two-dimensional printed forms, can I do what I am proposing/asking here? How do I learn enough about materials, behaviors, situations, philosophy, history, physics, energy, biology, sociology, anthropology, politics, etc. ...
20190221 If sustainable designers don't make design; what do we make?
20190222 I talk to much in my class. How do I make it more about doing! more about action! and not my doing and actions; all of our doings and actions!
20190223 How to fill up class time with action? preparation for action? how does Graphic Designing lead to action?
20190224 What am I trying to sustain? how are all these other actions and design choices and hardware swaps and whatever doing anything actually?
20190225 Toward a slow technology. How to slow down everything. What can I get rid of? abandon? disown? disuse? what can I use better? what can I change? how do I change? Number one. no more streaming video? does that matter? do I just need to actually get out and act -- stop reading and thinking and debating and procrastinating and just do...
20190225 This is also getting a little diary like? maybe try to refocus on sentences that point towards action that points towards something done, something changed, not just pose personal questions?
20190226 Define design ethics.
20190227 Define sustainabilitist ethics.
20190228 Machine learning neural network layout instructions robot. How to come up with this? how to train? what is it good for? does it only take in/out put instructions? are they just text? any visuals at all? do humans try to interpret the instructions themselves literally perhaps?

20190301 So, if a robot can help write; can a robot help design?
20190302 I don't want to have a robot replace me; replace us -- I want a robot to help me reuse old ideas; resurface past options; find interesting combinations of things I wouldn't have thought of or tried. All from my own existing detritus. How to train a machine on all my existing output to help create new output that takes its source material as the old? Sort of a conceptual, material reuse project?
20190303 I have so much stuff; so many public domain and otherwise images, typefaces, drawings, layouts, whatever, already created; how can I put them to use on the enxt stuff I do? how can I get into the making things look good part and speed up the basics? well, the goal isn't even to speed up the rest it is to help with creative and intellectual burnout.
20190304 Where do I start activating these ideas for my project? Who cares about these things? do I need a client that cares? do I just force it upon everything?
20190305 Also! who do I need my next clients to be? If I am all in on the sustaino-libre stuff; what are the kinds of things I must investigate? And, how does being a "graphic designer" play into all this when/if/as my projects become more about software development; more about building bicycles; more about actions or interventions; more about proposals and plans?
20190306 Well, it is proving to be the case that I can make what I want (at least mostly look the way I wish based on what I would be making otherwise) so, so far, experimenting will continue forward.
20190307 Is it important to remix other culture into my cultural creations? does reusing and remixing create new metaphors? new ideas? better analogies? more interesting connections? richer futures?
20190308 Quality is essential because quantity is impossible.
20190309 Sustainability is essential because there are no other options. Is it about sustainability. What do we want to sustain? Is sustaining really the point? how do we make it improved over time; how do we make it restorative over time.
20190309 Do more with less. Do the most with nothing (do everything with nothing?). Sustainable graphic design does not exist.
20190310 How do I actually do all that? I know I like to say how the sustainabilitist principles project exemplifies "sustainable design does not exist" since the objects came together to be a sculpture for an exhibition and then went back to being the objects afterward -- but how does that work for other kinds of projects? can I work with clients and still pitch that kind of solution?
20190311 Why worry about this; is just doing defaults suffice?
20190312 Except I do care if things are "good" or not ... so just defaulting it up without any know how isn't a panacea.
20190313 But I do acknowledge that mostly what is good is what is familiar.
20190314 Whew. So I have some cyclical thinking. You need to make a lot; look at a lot; think a lot to really understand goodness. You also need to have varying levels of goodness and badness around you to really comprehend good vs bad. You have to have tried a lot; experienced a lot; been open to researching many things; many ways; etc.
20190315 How does one really then make good design? what is definitively good? I think there are good and bad behaviors; how does that translate to making of visuals?
20190315 Maybe I shouldn't feel so weird being declarative about things...
20190316 Less is More. More is Less. Less is a Bore. Boring is less exciting. Is more stuff then more exciting? is that the point of designing? Do more with Less. What does that actually entail or imply?
20190316 What does sustainable design look like? should it look intentionally different to tell everyone that its not the same? If the paradigm must shift; then the styles should probably shift as well to be clear that they are in all ways different? By just using different tools and typefaces and image sources do you do this? does it need to be more extreme than that?
20190316 So; on the extreme side; there is this "Sustainable graphic design does not exist" idea I've had for a while. The point is not that literally you can't make it (though that is sort of what I was thinking at first), but that a graphic designed thing that is sustainable comes together to communicate the message it needs to communicate; and then can dematerialize back to its initial parts once the communicative need is over. How does "signs on a substrate" translate to "pieces coming together for a determinate amount of time and then returning to their constituent pieces" -- oh man.
20190316 What should we be making? who should we be making things for? Does being a graphic designer (does being a web/digital designer) affect the way I answer these questions -- would I answer them differently if I were making "industrial design" type objects instead; if I were making buildings instead???
20190316 Make an object that lives forever.
20190317 Graphic Design a thing that lives forever?
20190318 Sustainabilitize a graphic design so that it lives forever? wait, is this the point? If sustainable graphic design doesn't exist -- meaning that things come together to server a purpose then can go back to their original constituent parts -- does a piece of GD need to live forever? perhaps this is better put through the lens of perennial agriculture or permaculture or no till or something? what is perennial graphic design that is restorative to culture -- that protects and builds cultural health (the same way that prairie grasses build and protect the soil health of the plains?).
20190319 Sleep more. Do less. Do More with Less. Can we be of help to the planet? Is doing more with less useful? should be just be doing less period? being workaholics is probably bad for earth not just us.
20190320 I must do a better job inhabiting the correct state of being. My current "form" isn't doing my hopes justice.
20190321 It is the first day of Spring. How might I spring into action on ACTING on some of these impulses? How does graphic designing give all of its raw ingredients the most respect possible?
20190321 what the heck did I do to nano? why aren't there any line wraps working as I desire? everything looks horrible. I guess I need to a) write a theme for it? and maybe figure out some more things about the config files? or do I find something else to utilize for writing and editing and such? vi? vim? wtf.
20190322 So, if I am not graphic designing then what am I doing; what do I call myself? how can I keep teaching?
20190323 I don't need to practice what I preach; I need to preach even if I don't/can't yet practice it -- keep things moving forward faster and better even if I myself am not yet capable of fully embracing it all.
20190324 Real people. Real projects. Real progregit pulss? Real success? Real what? 20190325 What should design do?  git pul
20190326 What are we designing? who are we desiggit pulning for? what people are to be helped? what services to be provided?  git pul
20190327 Missing a few days.
20190328 What is so enticing about a catchy tv sgit pulhow or a website or an app or a drug? how could that be harnessed for good -- is harnessingit pulg any "addictive" aspect of something bad by default?  git pul
20190329 Finish what you start. There was a thregit pulad here but it has been lost -- tiredness? too much other stuff going on?  git pul
20190330 Is any design good? Is any design meantgit pul for commercial consumption good?
20190331 Why do I design? Maybe that is a good question to focus on?

20190401 New month. New thoughts.
20190402 Start to explain the reduce/reuse/recycle exercises from Sustainable graphic design: why was it useful? what is it good for? how do those things help with design processes generally?
20190402 Time to get writing more than just a sentence a day. Keep this going; but get some of these other thoughts down into their own essays too! f tv watching. just write! and sleep!
20190403 Real people and real projects. IS that what SGD is missing right now? why I feel so unsatisfied? all we've done is talk... students have read a lot learned a lot talked a lot -- but have we not done enough???
20190404 What does "doing" mean? is "doing" making more meaningless designed things; or does being wiser count as "doing" design?
20190405 What is there to talk about when you don't talk about what something looks like -- how do you talk about what a design _is_ like
20190406 What does that even mean; what design _is_ like?
20190407 This gets us back to the form <-> content <-> context kinds of discussions I get into.
20190408 So I want to talk about what design is doing: who is it for? why does it exist? what good does it do? etc.
20190409 That is important to me sustainability wise too -- restorative design wise? -- but that I need to get more towards real projects; real people; and real improvements…
20140410 But what does that mean? what is "real"?
20140411 Real as in things that affect regular people's lives? can it still be utopian AND be real? is this where the pragmatic utopianism comes in?
20140412 How can a new idea for a design classroom be realized that does this better? Something like a 18-20 something designergarten?
20140413 Froebel's gifts for designers.
20140414 What good have I done today?
20140415 A responsible designer. A socially responsible designer. An environmentally responsible designer.
20190416 How does one actually do this all? What is a responsible designer???
20190417 why can't I just go to sleep.
20190418 What are the implications of designing in the crisis filled era we find ourselves? what does "graphic designing" do to heal and restore the world? how does can making anew unmake all the old? And what the fuck does my practice have to do with any of it. Why can't I make anything useful myself??????s (this is more than a sentence). Okay. So what am I going to do. (and why be so open in an open source readme?). Why is it so easy to do nothing; and not the right kind of nothing.
20190418 Froebel's gifts for sustainabilitists.
this20190419 There are a lot of ways perhaps that designing isn't the outcome of the sustainabilitist process; its just part of the proces -- that one must design something to communicate something else or cause some behavorial change or whatever.
20190420 I found a lot of interesting material studies in the [_Why Materials Matter_ book (by Seetal Solanki)](https://amzn.to/2Xz9PHh) -- so many interesting experiments; so few help me think about “graphic designing.” Maybe do another flip through; focus on the paper substrates; the inks? Is carbon black made from exhaust/smog really a sustainable direction though???
20190421 Bjorn means better materials.
20190422 What are local and reusable materials I could start playing with? making my own paper? creating sheets of remade plastic "paper"? digging and making my own clay to make tablets out of? firing pages that way? what do I produce with those things? plates to print from? stamps? seals? do I draw and compose right into clay? what else allows me to put "signs on substrates" in a meaningful way that continues to let me "graphic design" but really does something about material usage; education; communication; etc???
20190423 Design experiment.
20190424 What is an experiment? what is a design experiment?
20190425 Am I a sustainable designer? or am I a sustainable person that happens to design -- everything I design is thus influenced by my sustainabilitism. Designing follows one's personhood?
20190426 What are the raw materials of graphic design: how do I "recycle" my old works to create new raw materials to build new design from? do I need to recycle -- can i just reuse?
20190425 What does success mean for my practice. What does success mean for sustainable graphic design. How is design sustainable. What new words better describe what I am talking about. Flourishing. Regenerative. Adaptable. Praxis. Resiliant. Systematic. Interconnected.
20190427 Weird.
20190427 I've lost my train of thought.
20190428 Life is hard. Designing is hard. Sustainability is hard. Restoration is hard. Maintenance is hard.
20190429 What are we doing? how do we help each other?
20190430 Is trying to write every single day in this fast way smart or useful? what have I captured that is worth it?

20190501 I have 145 lines of stops and starts.
20190502 Form is king / no! content is king / No! CONTEXT IS KING! No! Queen? No! Benevolent dictator! Yes! Context is the benevolent dictator of a project!?
20190503 How do you teach that? what is the history lesson that readies one for that? how is context supreme and let to be freed and learned about???
20190504 Still so many questions. How can everything I write about or think about or try to tackle always be a question; lead to more questions; not be a fact or answer or clear, end result?
20190505 What is experimental graphic design? what is a design experiment -- I am still thinking about this from a meeting a few weeks ago (looks like 20190424). Should sustainable/restorative/flourishing design require that it be experimental? what hypothesis is a design proving or disproving? is that a real metric for a formal exercise?
20190506 Speaking of hypothesis; is that the problem with our current designing? we don't have any hypotheses -- we just replicate answers from before that never really were experiments; they weren't readily tested or smartly planned; just done and then repeated ad infinitum.
20190507 Experiments: how many different ways can one hide/show or min/max a menu? what do we use to determine goodness and badness in this experiment? How did the famous roadsignage design projects pan out -- what were their starting hypotheses and how was designing iterations part of a real experimentation process? did it really yield superior design? What other examples and successes/failures am I aware of? What is a control in a design?
20190508 Write a song. Is that also a design project?
20190509 If a song is a design project; what isn't a design project?
20190510 What is the goal of "designing." If everything is a design project; is making new forms important; isn't just fixing what needs fixing an example of "good design" -- does the solution need to be novel? (I'm saying, if I design and sew a travelling silverware roll using salvaged cloth and found random silverware is that any less of a design project than designing a new folding "hobo knife" ???)
20190511 IF the answer is no, it's not different, then wtf, what am I do, what am I teaching? If the answer is yes, it is different; do I want to be a "designer" then? Why not just a vernacular crafter or maker or builder or whatever?
20150512 Is this counterculture modernism? Whole earthers did some things like this right? Zomes? Papanek's coffee can radio? A lot of reuse; but with the goal of making things people need in the moment? Still new things; but a repurposed or reconfigured materials based on what is at hand; what is readily available? What is design: making things we want? making things we need? Solving problems? what problems? whose problems?
20190513 Meeting re: a community project. What is the correct way to design for a diverse group of people that aren't you? that might not have your tastes or contexts? how does one understand them? what is design that speaks to _not_ me? that is historically and culturally “correct?”
20190514 What is a “professional” tool? Does this mean a mac? does this mean adobe creative suite? does this mean a specific programming lanaguge or framework? Is professionalism a set of tools; or is it the wisdom, skill, and care necessary to make the best possible thing no matter what tools one is using? Is it making your own tools???? Is a visual designer who uses GNU/Linux and F/LOS design software no longer a “professional” -- is it really the output that matter? that I can produce press ready PDFs, is that what makes me a professional? is it knowledge/skill in form, typography, composition, balance, color, etc? What skills or tools differentiate a professional designer from an amateur one?
20190515 Make your own tools. Ala Kiel!? Ask a lot of questions.
20190515 What else can I learn about a design from its contexts?
20190515 Stabilizing the climate isn't about reducing emissions, we have to *zero* our emissions; & actually remove carbon from the atmosphere. Driving an EV doesn't  cut it…. replacing a car w/ a used bicycle & your lawn with a permaculture garden is a better start.
20190516 Some confusing territory; why is it so hard to write a learning outcome?
20190516 Relational ontologies of graphic design.
20190516 Why do people have houses? All they do is fall apart. 
20190517 embrace the speculative? embrace the irrational? embrace the new or strange or different or experimenta$
20190517 What reasons do I have to make one thing one way or another? why should we make a thing one way or another?
20190518 I ordered a thinkpad. is that going to make being "liberated" easier? it for sure looks different than my normal macbookairing around.
20190519 Decolonized design should probably use liberated tools. If you are still designing with Adobe and Macs you aren't decolonized. They're cultural colonizers -- bringing their way of doing things; their technologies to every place they visit and decide to set down in…
20190520 That last thing has legs; but I need to think it through a bit more. How am I not a design colonizer?
20190520 Avoid solely hanging out with other designers in pretty spaces.
20190520 to change a system; intervene in small ways around the edges … at some point that system will react to those changes and be made to change ??? is this true? can this work? small is not less important than big in a complex system.
20190520 no one said "hey, lets see if we can F up everyting on this planet" BUT it is what we did!
20190520 If innovation & creativity & growth & modernity & progress & development are all so “good” — why is shit so fucked? These are neutral words; not default “good” words. If you are applying “innovation” to the wrong thing it can be bad…
20190520 Life centered design.
20190521 What's my honest, authentic way of designing? What's my honest, authentic way of being and how does that then influence my designing?
20190522 What is the node/map/tree/cloud/whatever structure that ties all these things together?
20190523 Is that a good "next thing to do with all of these ideas" see how they visually/conceptually interlink and try to "graphic design" something up from them? that then shows me the next thing to do; the next thing to write down?
20190523 Designing Tomorrow's World Today.
20190524 New trains of thought almost everyday. The downside to this project.
20190524 Inaction is still an action.
20190525 It was a good time prepping my design is x or y or z and this is what you should do "lecture" for the parents graduation weekend. I should try to write more lectures; do more talks; do more real writing down and explaining of my points of view. Maybe that will then help me actually implement it on something?
20190526 There is a real internal conflict raging in my practice (practices? praxis? or is it that it isn't yet a praxis that is the problem?) -- why can't I do a better job of DOING the things I claim to think/believe in/promote etc? I so bad at ACTION.
20190527 Running out of time. Design needs to cause massive cultural shift; massive action FAST SOON IMMEDIATELY.
20190528 What design does this; what did the messaging around Ozone depletion look like? What about carson's silent spring related anti-chemical rhetoric? what about WWII "we need you" type things? Oh man, that's a great resource -- war time propoganda posters. Does that stuff work now? what is cultural convincing design now? what is design that causes people to follow and just do? 
20190528 There is a difference between living and living free.
20190529 Should we use the status quo against itself? do most people really just do what it seems everyone else is doing? The downside to that is I don't think its really in the ethics of "sustainability" to just shepherd along the masses blindly -- I don't want to recreate a status quo where people just do whatever eveyrone is doing only now the default "normal" things are what I think are good... I want people to really think about their actions; change what "convenient" means; believe in something; value something. Value it because they've asked themselves why is x better than y really? What does that look like? is that restorative design? restoring a person's ability to think critically and make an actual choice? 
20190529 What if you are good at something that doesn’t appear to have any use to your society?
20190529 Nothing is permanently our own.
20190529 Survival of the most generous interconnected groups.
20190529 Individual and collective freedoms.
20190530 Life affirming design. restorative design. sustainable design. entropic design. adaptable design. designing as flourishing. 
20190531 I do like this life-affirming design thing. How do I get more into that? or rather how do I frame any and all projects moving forward from that vantage?

20190601 Month 6. Woah. Is this life affirming?
20190602 Does it matter what GNU/Linux distro I install? Should I focus on maximum Libre-ness? Usability? designerly-ness?
20190603 Does it matter what laptop I have? is there something useful about having a slightly out of date, refurbished thinkpad? Should I try to use my raspberry pis more? Or why not just force my MacBookAirs into service? Is focusing on Maximum-Libre-ness the important part? I guess being able to have only linux installed will be fun/useful on the thinkpad...
20190604 Tomorrow's Ideas for Today's Culture. What does that mean? Is that useful -- how do I make my vision of tomorrow understandable to today's society?
20190604 People cry out “should designers code?” but what about “should engineers design?”
20190604 do something. do something to that. then, do something else to that.
20190604 do you want to design objects for businesses to be owned and sold and controlled or design a commons? services for all owned by no-one (or alternately everyone)
20190604 after seriously using inkscape, scribus, gimp & a few other libre graphics tools for a while… I need to write something up… inkscape is a great tool; I'm still trying to do illustrator-y things out of muscle & mental memory; but it's the easiest thing to just use so far.
