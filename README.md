# A Sentence A Day (SAD)
Writing sentences. Day by Day. Trying to make something. Piece by Piece. It is not actually SAD. Hopefully it will be HAPPY -- or at least HOPEFUL/HELPFUL.

20190101 How to move towards a more sustainable graphic design practice?
20190102 My GNU/Linux experiments are one such effort.
20190103 Reusing old design ideas another.
20190104 Now, is spending hundreds of hours trying to learn things about GNU/Linux sustainable though (the general open sourcery as a whole)?
20190105 The GNU ecosystem is fully into reusing old ideas — just reusing ideas period.
20190106 Free software allows for creative waste to become creative food.
20190107 Does that make free software as a whole more sustainable?
20190108 The ecosystem for libre tools is more like a natural ecosystem: you see darwinian style evolution; variations due to minor differences of philosophy or habit or desire.
20190109 If the way our tools are built and subsequently evolve is more like nature; more like natural cycles/processes; does that make those tools then fit into our lives, society, culture — whatever — in more “natural” ways? does it allow for more natural ways of using them? (natural meaning finding harmony with nature; being more "a part" of nature rather than "apart" from nature... (something about Eli Heuer's open source over estimates your skills, so you have to learn and grow and try harder? -- https://twitter.com/eliheuer/status/1081627442220068865))
20190109 Github is my new dropbox. but should I switch to gitlab? that's open... oh, should I run my own gitlab server???
20190110 How about the ideals?
20190111 Do the ideals of F/LOSS align better with the ideals of sustainability?
20190112 Does "all humans and other life should flourish" fit into F/LOSS as an ideal?
20190113 Or rather, does F/LOSS help achieve flourishing more than proprietary software might/will?
20190114 What I am really trying to suss out here is where and how do my interests in Design serving a flourishing/wellfare of all life agenda and my interests in F/LOSS design overlap; how are they additive; how do they serve each other.
20190115 The other direction this goes, is why do any of this at all? why design? why compute? why care about liberated tools? why be a designer — why am I not just a farmer or garbage collector or something?
20190115 Okay, reasoning: our current capitalist constructs DO NOT improve the wellfare of all life; the origins of F/LOSS are also anti-capitalist -- or at least anti valuing making a buck over being good to your neighbor -- so, if you have to use software, F/LOSS is more likely to AID you in helping all life flourish than proprietary/non-free softwares.
20190116 Is this provable? or measureable?
20190117 Waste = Food; what other ways can I find that this is true for creative kinds of waste? As I mentioned before I think that in some ways F/LOSS improves upon this equation.
20190118 The philosophical issue I run into here is, well, what exactly is my goal as a designer? what do I want to design? is desinging solving any of the problems I am pointing out -- did it just create them in the first place?
20190118 The Libre Designer; The Sustainabilitist Designer; Are the tools the connection? are these things the same? It feels like a synergy...
20190119 Is this also how vernacular patterns/building come into the picture -- are free/libre open models the new vernacular (is that how I make my designing today more like the way say a Cape Cod house comes together?)
20190120 It is good to experience other spaces, other realms, where what graphic design is used for is different (and how graphic design looks is understood differently).
20190120 Dunne and Raby propose that design should explore activities and outcomes that question and challenge status quo industrial agendas--however! for the most part the designers doing this are still using status quo tools! Sustainability (at least the flourishing variety I am interested in) is NOT the current status quo; so if I am challenging the assumptions of contemporary design and capitalist consumerism, then I need non-capitalist consumerist tools to do that with--enter F/LOSS.
20190121 F/LOSS seems to be hard for traditional designers to break into though. Why?
20190122 Web focused designers HAVE for the most part embraced the open source ideal — work is on github, there are at least many designers using things like bootstrap, react, etc. And plenty, though less, commiting to projects and making their own new ones (jxnblk & mrmrs are good examples).
20190123 Even more traditionally print designers; or just designers deisgning for the web even if they aren't capable of building/programming are aware of plenty of open projects and open source fonts (google fonts) — so what's the hard part to migrate designing tools???
20190124 An issue may just be that while the web is built on open standards, our traditional desktop computers have not. So, while you might be used to thinking in SVG and JS and HTML and CSS and Wordpress and Drupal and React and Node and whatever other F/LOS kinds of things in a web realm; you aren't necessarily thiknking about making those things w/ free/open tools.
20190125 Creating graphics has for the most part been a proprietary environment — one had to buy fonts, or at least access to the fonts (you had to buy a case of type; you had to buy sheets of letraset; you had to pay a phototypesetter for the type you wanted set and they bought their font photo-negatives from the foundries, etc.), and when the creation of layouts moved to the computer... hmmm, losing my train of thought here.
20190125 Generalization: designers are tool users not tool makers? so we use what we see is available; when we're shown the Adobe stuff and see that mostly the rest of our colleagues are using it; it makes sense to do that — the file formats don't port, so we have not much choice.
20190129 Why have a process? What is a process? what is process? How do you define process?
20190130 Does "Switch to libre tools" count as a process?
20190131 Do you have to change your computer, your operating system, your software; or are there just free/libre

20190201 Sustainable Graphic Design is a mindset, not necessarily a checklist of "the right" materials — now, it can't be the wrong materials either, but it's not just the right materials…
20190202 If you have the right mindset, but still use the wrong materials, does it matter?
20190203 If one uses better materials, but for the status quo aims, does it matter?
20190204 In what ways can I change how I work and live to yield immediate results?
20190205 I now have 3 iMacs, 5 Laptops, 3 raspberry Pis, & 5 Monitors of different sizes and ages (one is the sweet 1999 original Apple LCD in translucent turquise). Is that too many computers? 
20190206 Documentation of my libre attempts are a must. I need to find the time to actually get down some of the things I've tried and learned.
20190207 Is writing or audio/video recording better for that? I'll do it faster as audio recordings; but its more accessible as text right?
20190208 Waste = Food is a great idea to apply to more things than just the natural world. Here's a great prompt: the earth's major nutrients are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, & nitrogen … what are graphic design's major nutrients? (and! how can they be cycled and recycled into new graphic design indefintiely?????????)
20190208 Oh man, I need to setup a repo of just my fav libre fonts. then I can easily keep all my installs mac, gnu/linux, whatever, in sync.
20190209 As I get into this liberated OS, fonts, tools, etc. I realize that there have been more convenient, more helpful, more useful, whatever systems out there -- and most of us just never knew/didn't realize???
20190210 Some things are easier. Some are harder.
20190211 What the f is up with crappy weather days. 
20190212 I have this idea — sustainable graphic design does not exist. Now, that might mean "there is no such graphic design that can count as sustainable — its all wasteful garbage that does nothing good" — or — and this is the cool part — sustainable graphic design doesn't exist meaning that it comes together to serve a communication purpose; deliver a semiotic message; and then redistributes back to whatever energy and matter it was before.
20190212 Maybe try to write some more about that in another doc or repo or something? Reference my MFA work; what else can I find that is exemplarary of that idea?
20190212 That's more than just reuse for packaging or something; that is about harnessing a more entropic way of being.
20190213 What the hell am I doing.
20190214 What is romantic about sustainability? should we focus on that? are the facts and statistics and whatever else too scary? too boring? too real?
20190215 If there is a crisis, why aren't we hearing about it more? why aren't there more restrictions?
20190216 Sustainability is about knowing what you want to sustain. Libre tools are about a person's freedom to do what they want. If I don't want to sustain our moderno-techno-capitalism, then I should probably use libre tools while creating alternatives... what do I want to sustain though? It is easy to say what I don't want to sustain; less clear to say what I do want to.
20190217 I just spent the evening at an event that showed me why all is F-ed. I feel bad that I was a part of it frankly. So then what am I going to do to do something about that?
20190218 Designer as Activist. Designer as Farmer. Designer as Politician. Designer as general good doer out in the world -- not in the social design-y way, but just as regular person doing things to improve the contexts of their time and space.
20190219 What good do any of my design "tools" do me if just being a general good citizen; a general good human; is what I am after?
20190220 A designer needs to know a lot to really be good these days. I don't mean good as in makes formally pleasing work; I mean good as in really improves things; really exemplifies other ways of thinking and being. So how does one get this way? is this something to be learned? something to be taught? Is pedagogy buildable from these thoughts? If i teach in a graphic design program still rooted mainly in typography and static, flat, two-dimensional printed forms, can I do what I am proposing/asking here? How do I learn enough about materials, behaviors, situations, philosophy, history, physics, energy, biology, sociology, anthropology, politics, etc. ...
20190221 If sustainable designers don't make design; what do we make?
20190222 I talk to much in my class. How do I make it more about doing! more about action! and not my doing and actions; all of our doings and actions!
20190223 How to fill up classtime with action? preparation for action? how does Graphic Designing lead to action?
20190224 What am I trying to sustain? how are all these other actions and design choices and hardware swaps and whatever doing anything actually?
20190225 Toward a slow technology. How to slow down everything. What can I get rid of? abandon? disown? disuse? what can I use better? what can I change? how do I change? Number one. no more streaming video? does that matter? do I just need to actually get out and act — stop reading and thinking and debating and procrastinating and just do…
20190225 This is also getting a little diary like? maybe try to refocus on sentences that point towards action that points towrds something done, something changed, not just pose personal questions?
20190226 Define design ethics.
20190227 Define sustainabilitist ethics.
20190228 Machine learning neural network layout intructions robot. How to come up with this? how to train? what is it good for? does it only take in/out put instructions? are they just text? any visuals at all? do humans try to interpret the instructions themselves literally perhaps???

20190301 So, if a robot can help write; can a robot help design?
20190302 I don't want to have a robot replace me; replace us — I want a robot to help me reuse old ideas; resurface past options; find interesting combinations of things I wouldn't have thought of or tried. All from my own existing detritus. How to train a machine on all my existing output to help create new output that takes its source material as the old? Sort of a conceptual, material resuse project?
20190303 I have so much stuff; so many public domain and otherwise images, typefaces, drawings, layouts, whatever, already created; how can I put them to use on the enxt stuff I do? how can I get into the making things look good part and speed up the basics? well, the goal isn'ttt even to speed up the rest it is to help with creative and intellectual burnout. 
20190304 Where do I start activating these ideas for my project? Who cares about these things? do I need a client that cares? do I just force it upon everything?
20190305 Also! who do I need my next clients to be? If I am all in on the sustainao-libre stuff; what are the kinds of things I must investigate? And, how does being a "graphic designer" play into all this when/if/as my projects become more about software development; more about building bicycles; more about actions or interventions; more about proposals and plans?
20190306 Well, it is proving to be the case that I can make what I want (at least mostly look the way I wish based on what I would be making otherwise) so, so far, experimenting will continue forward.
20190307 Is it important to remix other culture into my cultural creations? does reusing and remixing create new metaphors? new ideas? better analogies? more interesting connections? richer futures?
20190308 Quality is essential because quantity is impossible. 
20190309 Sustainability is essential because there are no other options. Is it about sustainability. What do we want to sustain? Is sustaining really the point? how do we make it improved over time; how do we make it restorative over time. 
20190309 Do more with less. Do the most with nothing (do everything with nothing?). Sustainable graphic design does not exist.
20190310 How do I actually do all that? I know I like to say how the sustainabilitist principles project exemplifies "sustainable design does not exist" since the objects came together to be a sculpture for an exhibition and then went back to being the objects afterward — but how does that work for other kinds of projects? can I work with clients and still pitch that kind of solution?
20190311 Why worry about this; is just doing defaults suffice?
20190312 Except I do care if things are “good” or not … so just defaulting it up without any know how isn't a pancea.
20190313 But I do acknowledge that mostly what is good is what is familiar.
20190314 Whew. So I have some cyclical thinking. You need to make a lot; look at a lot; think a lot to really understand goodness. You also need to have varying levels of goodness and badness around you to really comprehend good vs bad. You have to have tried a lot; experienced a lot; been open to researching many things; many ways; etc.
20190315 How does one really then make good design? what is definitively good? I think there are good and bad behaviors; how does that translate to making of visuals?
20190315 Maybe I shouldn't feel so weird being declarative about things... 
20190316 Less is More. More is Less. Less is a Bore. Boring is less exciting. Is more stuff then more exciting? is that the point of designing? Do more with Less. What does that actually entail or imply?
20190316 What does sustainable design look like? should it look intentionally different to tell everyone that its not the same? If the paradigm must shift; then the styles should probably shift as well to be clear that they are in all ways different? By just using different tools and typefaces and image sources do you do this? does it need to be more extreme than that?
20190316 So; on the extreme side; there is this "Sustainable graphic design does not exist" idea I've had for a while. The point is not that literally you can't make it (though that is sort of what I was thinking at first), but that a graphic designed thing that is sustainable comes together to communicate the message it needs to communicate; and then can dematerialize back to its initial parts once the communicative need is over. How does "signs on a substrate" translate to "pieces coming together for a determinate amount of time and then returning to their constiuent pieces" -- oh man.
20190316 What should we be making? who should we be making things for? Does being a graphic designer (does being a web/digital designer) affect the way I answer these questions -- would I answer them differently if I were making "inudstrial design" type objects instead; if I were making buildings instead???
20190316 Make an object that lives forever.
20190317 Graphic Design a thing that lives forever?
20190318 Sustainabilitize a graphic design so that it lives forever? wait, is this the point? If sustainable graphic design doesn't exist -- meaning that 
things come together to server a purpose then can go back to their original consituent parts -- does a piece of GD need to live forever? perhaps this is 
better put through the lens of perrenial agriculture or permaculture or no till or something? what is perennial graphic design that is restorative to culture 
-- that protects and builds cultural health (the same way that prairie grasses build and protect the soil health of the plains?).
