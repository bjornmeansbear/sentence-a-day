# A Sentence A Day (SAD)
Writing sentences. Day by Day. Trying to make something. Piece by Piece. It is not actually SAD. Hopefully it will be HAPPY -- or at least HOPEFUL/HELPFUL.

20190101 How to move towards a more sustainable graphic design practice?
20190102 My GNU/Linux experiments are one such effort.
20190103 Reusing old design ideas another.
20190104 Now, is spending hundreds of hours trying to learn things about GNU/Linux sustainable though (the general open sourcery as a whole)?
20190105 The GNU ecosystem is fully into reusing old ideas — just reusing ideas period.
20190106 Free software allows for creative waste to become creative food.
20190107 Does that make free software as a whole more sustainable?
20190108 The ecosystem for libre tools is more like a natural ecosystem: you see darwinian style evolution; variations due to minor differences of philosophy or habit or desire.
20190109 If the way our tools are built and subsequently evolve is more like nature; more like natural cycles/processes; does that make those tools then fit into our lives, society, culture — whatever — in more “natural” ways? does it allow for more natural ways of using them? (natural meaning finding harmony with nature; being more "a part" of nature rather than "apart" from nature... (something about Eli Heuer's open source over estimates your skills, so you have to learn and grow and try harder? -- https://twitter.com/eliheuer/status/1081627442220068865))
20190109 Github is my new dropbox. but should I switch to gitlab? that's open... oh, should I run my own gitlab server???
20190110 How about the ideals?
20190111 Do the ideals of F/LOSS align better with the ideals of sustainability?
20190112 Does "all humans and other life should flourish" fit into F/LOSS as an ideal?
20190113 Or rather, does F/LOSS help achieve flourishing more than proprietary software might/will?
20190114 What I am really trying to suss out here is where and how do my interests in Design serving a flourishing/wellfare of all life agenda and my interests in F/LOSS design overlap; how are they additive; how do they serve each other.
20190115 The other direction this goes, is why do any of this at all? why design? why compute? why care about liberated tools? why be a designer — why am I not just a farmer or garbage collector or something?
20190115 Okay, reasoning: our current capitalist constructs DO NOT improve the wellfare of all life; the origins of F/LOSS are also anti-capitalist -- or at least anti valuing making a buck over being good to your neighbor -- so, if you have to use software, F/LOSS is more likely to AID you in helping all life flourish than proprietary/non-free softwares.
20190116 Is this provable? or measureable?
20190117 Waste = Food; what other ways can I find that this is true for creative kinds of waste? As I mentioned before I think that in some ways F/LOSS improves upon this equation.
20190118 The philosophical issue I run into here is, well, what exactly is my goal as a designer? what do I want to design? is desinging solving any of the problems I am pointing out -- did it just create them in the first place?
20190118 The Libre Designer; The Sustainabilitist Designer; Are the tools the connection? are these things the same? It feels like a synergy...
20190119 Is this also how vernacular patterns/building come into the picture -- are free/libre open models the new vernacular (is that how I make my designing today more like the way say a Cape Cod house comes together?)
20190120 It is good to experience other spaces, other realms, where what graphic design is used for is different (and how graphic design looks is understood differently).
20190120 Dunne and Raby propose that design should explore activities and outcomes that question and challenge status quo industrial agendas--however! for the most part the designers doing this are still using status quo tools! Sustainability (at least the flourishing variety I am interested in) is NOT the current status quo; so if I am challenging the assumptions of contemporary design and capitalist consumerism, then I need non-capitalist consumerist tools to do that with--enter F/LOSS.
20190121 F/LOSS seems to be hard for traditional designers to break into though. Why?
20190122 Web focused designers HAVE for the most part embraced the open source ideal — work is on github, there are at least many designers using things like bootstrap, react, etc. And plenty, though less, commiting to projects and making their own new ones (jxnblk & mrmrs are good examples).
20190123 Even more traditionally print designers; or just designers deisgning for the web even if they aren't capable of building/programming are aware of plenty of open projects and open source fonts (google fonts) — so what's the hard part to migrate designing tools???
20190124 An issue may just be that while the web is built on open standards, our traditional desktop computers have not. So, while you might be used to thinking in SVG and JS and HTML and CSS and Wordpress and Drupal and React and Node and whatever other F/LOS kinds of things in a web realm; you aren't necessarily thiknking about making those things w/ free/open tools.
20190125 Creating graphics has for the most part been a proprietary environment — one had to buy fonts, or at least access to the fonts (you had to buy a case of type; you had to buy sheets of letraset; you had to pay a phototypesetter for the type you wanted set and they bought their font photo-negatives from the foundries, etc.), and when the creation of layouts moved to the computer... hmmm, losing my train of thought here.
20190125 Generalization: designers are tool users not tool makers? so we use what we see is available; when we're shown the Adobe stuff and see that mostly the rest of our colleagues are using it; it makes sense to do that — the file formats don't port, so we have not much choice.
20190129 Why have a process? What is a process? what is process? How do you define process?
20190130 Does "Switch to libre tools" count as a process?
20190131 Do you have to change your computer, your operating system, your software; or are there just free/libre

20190201 Sustainable Graphic Design is a mindset, not necessarily a checklist of "the right" materials — now, it can't be the wrong materials either, but it's not just the right materials…
20190202 If you have the right mindset, but still use the wrong materials, does it matter?
20190203 If one uses better materials, but for the status quo aims, does it matter?
20190204 In what ways can I change how I work and live to yield immediate results?
20190205 I now have 3 iMacs, 5 Laptops, 3 raspberry Pis, & 5 Monitors of different sizes and ages (one is the sweet 1999 original Apple LCD in translucent turquise). Is that too many computers? 
20190206 Documentation of my libre attempts are a must. I need to find the time to actually get down some of the things I've tried and learned.
20190207 Is writing or audio/video recording better for that? I'll do it faster as audio recordings; but its more accessible as text right?
20190208 Waste = Food is a great idea to apply to more things than just the natural world. Here's a great prompt: the earth's major nutrients are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, & nitrogen … what are graphic design's major nutrients? (and! how can they be cycled and recycled into new graphic design indefintiely?????????)
20190208 Oh man, I need to setup a repo of just my fav libre fonts. then I can easily keep all my installs mac, gnu/linux, whatever, in sync.
20190209 As I get into this liberated OS, fonts, tools, etc. I realize that there have been more convenient, more helpful, more useful, whatever systems out there -- and most of us just never knew/didn't realize???
20190210 Some things are easier. Some are harder.
20190211 What the f is up with crappy weather days. 
20190212 I have this idea — sustainable graphic design does not exist. Now, that might mean "there is no such graphic design that can count as sustainable — its all wasteful garbage that does nothing good" — or — and this is the cool part — sustainable graphic design doesn't exist meaning that it comes together to serve a communication purpose; deliver a semiotic message; and then redistributes back to whatever energy and matter it was before.
20190212 Maybe try to write some more about that in another doc or repo or something? Reference my MFA work; what else can I find that is exemplarary of that idea?
20190212 That's more than just reuse for packaging or something; that is about harnessing a more entropic way of being.
20190213 What the hell am I doing.
20190214 What is romantic about sustainability? should we focus on that? are the facts and statistics and whatever else too scary? too boring? too real?
20190215 If there is a crisis, why aren't we hearing about it more? why aren't there more restrictions?
20190216 Sustainability is about knowing what you want to sustain. Libre tools are about a person's freedom to do what they want. If I don't want to sustain our moderno-techno-capitalism, then I should probably use libre tools while creating alternatives... what do I want to sustain though? It is easy to say what I don't want to sustain; less clear to say what I do want to.
20190217 I just spent the evening at an event that showed me why all is F-ed. I feel bad that I was a part of it frankly. So then what am I going to do to do something about that?
20190218 Designer as Activist. Designer as Farmer. Designer as Politician. Designer as general good doer out in the world -- not in the social design-y way, but just as regular person doing things to improve the contexts of their time and space.
20190219 What good do any of my design "tools" do me if just being a general good citizen; a general good human; is what I am after?
20190220 A designer needs to know a lot to really be good these days. I don't mean good as in makes formally pleasing work; I mean good as in really improves things; really exemplifies other ways of thinking and being. So how does one get this way? is this something to be learned? something to be taught? Is pedagogy buildable from these thoughts? If i teach in a graphic design program still rooted mainly in typography and static, flat, two-dimensional printed forms, can I do what I am proposing/asking here? How do I learn enough about materials, behaviors, situations, philosophy, history, physics, energy, biology, sociology, anthropology, politics, etc. ...
20190221 If sustainable designers don't make design; what do we make?
20190222 I talk to much in my class. How do I make it more about doing! more about action! and not my doing and actions; all of our doings and actions!
20190223 How to fill up classtime with action? preparation for action? how does Graphic Designing lead to action?
20190224 What am I trying to sustain? how are all these other actions and design choices and hardware swaps and whatever doing anything actually?
