# A Sentence-A-Day (SAD)

_Nano Key Command Notes:_

- line numbers: `shift + alt + 3`
- line wrap: `esc + $`

Writing sentences. Day by Day. Trying to make something. Piece by Piece. It is not actually SAD. Hopefully it will be HAPPY -- or at least HOPEFUL/HELPFUL.

This project first debuted in 2019. There is a 2019 branch that saves where things were as of 202001010001. Current `master` branch is 02021. The project is (hopefully) expanding. @bjornmeansbear will continue to write sentences somewhat daily in the readme. But! the repo will start to also include essays or Q&A or back-and-forth threads from other humans. The goal: turn some of the couple good starts from 2019 into some dialog and/or discussion — or even actual projects and action.

## January 02020

20200113 Off to a slow start. Re-reading notes on the synthesis of form yet again. what about sustainability (restorative practice?) are the right constraints/contexts to generate forms from? is every time + space thus different? are there no universals? semiotic, architectural, or otherwise?

## January 02021

Back at this after a break for 2020.

The goal this time around is to actually generate some coherent directions for lectures, writing, essays, consulting ideas... turn them into something over my coming sabbatical hopefully.

## June 02021

020210601: Trying to get back to writing. Trying to get back to thinking. Trying to get back to clarifying. Writing down ideas and questions and clarifying statements about how sustainability, climate change, design, and life in general might fit together. The hope; well; that I generate something useful for my practice, for my family, and for these communities around me — maybe even that it can be some variety of publishable things. Here's to spaceship earth.

The rules for 020210601 and onward?

- Pick a prompt
  - like from <https://www.are.na/kristian-bjornard/sgd-01-what-is-worth-sustaining> or <https://www.are.na/kristian-bjornard/sustainability-plo> or similar...
- Write for at least 30 minutes.
- Notate the current PPM of C02. (<https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/monthly.html>)
- ?

Notes for writing:

- How can I switch things to make sure I use typographers quotes, etc. even if in .md or .txt? and other special characters for typographic excellence...
- ???

as of 020210611 I installed tiddly wiki, use `tiddlywiki sad2021tw --listen` to make it work!

okay, going to go through this: https://nesslabs.com/tiddlywiki-static-website-generator -- see if I can make some export improvements, maybe somehow go right to the gh-pages branch!?
