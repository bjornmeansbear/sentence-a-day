# A Sentence-A-Day (SAD)

```
Notes:
line numbers: shift + alt + 3
line wrap: esc + $
```

Writing sentences. Day by Day. Trying to make something. Piece by Piece. It is not actually SAD. Hopefully it will be HAPPY -- or at least HOPEFUL/HELPFUL.

This project first debuted in 2019. There is a 2019 branch that saves where things were as of 202001010001. Current `master` branch is 02021. The project is (hopefully) expanding. @bjornmeansbear will continue to write sentences somewhat daily in the readme. But! the repo will start to also include essays or Q&A or back-and-forth threads from other humans. The goal: turn some of the couple good starts from 2019 into some dialog and/or discussion â€” or even actual projects and action.

## January
20200113 Off to a slow start. Re-reading notes on the synthesis of form yet again. what about sustainability (restorative practice?) are the right constraints/contexts to generate forms from? is every time + space thus different? are there no universals? semiotic, architectural, or otherwise?
