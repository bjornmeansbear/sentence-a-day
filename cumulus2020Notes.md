# Possibilities/Interests

how to investigate how to participate w/ Cumulus

Circular economy -- how to frame this idea in the context of CCFAAD? Can it be part of someting we do over the fall? let it be a choice in projects?

Can we use the UNSDG #12 as a framework for thinking about behavior/action change?

Leslie is workin on this LDPE project... are there any students that want to collaborate with them? 

Is there viability w/out having to do too much extra stuff?

Introduce the competition and criteria -- do students want to do someting with this? What if no one does???

Are there more ways to do a showcase on campus? do we focus on plastic? is there a way to group or curate on our end?

Make sure to send this to the students of sustainability students as well (and the concentrators generally)

It is easy to organize the class; how to organize the concentrators and SOS members; see if they can take more of the reins themselves. There is support structure if available; let's see what happens -- Thrive w/ Baltimore! does that work well in this Cumulus thing?

Showcase and Reception (make the cumulus awards a cool thing to encourage other students to get into it too)

Let's use the idea of the student group as a hub/touchpoint to help solicit work even wider than our classes.

Does SOS need to be a clearing house for submissions? how much curation is necessary? Do we have our own exhibition and competition which then selects what we submit @ the end? Anyone can submit.

Empower the students!

Can it be part of AD1 too? 

Encourage multi disciplinary work -- teams? collaboratins? anti-discipline? 

How can that groupd of students think about organzing w/ faculty mentorship -- where can they create their own collaborative opportunities? Cross program possibilities???

any chance of minigrants for trying a new process or material? 

IS FYE a meaningful place to engage this too? also a way to recruit sustainability concentrators

What about grad students???

How big do we want to make this? 

Cumulus is a great org that supports faculty and students; but if its our first try; is it too much too fast/soon???`
