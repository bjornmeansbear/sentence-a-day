The ultimate aim of design must be restoring ​harmony in our carbon systems. No longer can we produce ​ meaningess tchotkes and devices and apps and software. ​ No design may be created without first asking "does this need to exist? does this help drawn down carbon? does this restor e balance to broken natural ​ sytsms systems?

We need concious​, cooperative effort of all artists, designers, politicians, cratfspeople , scientists, farmers, etc.

Designers mucst recognize anew and learn to grasp the composite character of climate (the climate? the earth? nature?) as a holistic entity and in its separate, interconnceted parts. Only then will our desinging be imbued witht he spirit it has lost as mere servent of capitalism.

Old styles and models for designing​ seemto be unable to produce this required new unity. ​

We must merge design with the workshop, the science lab, the forest, the ocean deapths, and the pulbic square. DEsigners must be athe nexus of connection bewteen all interestes and need. s. Our clinet is our climate. Our goal. to draw down carbon.
